00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
Welcome to the last lesson in cybersecurity GRC.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.980
We've already talked about individual GRC roles,

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.500
but we haven't yet spent much time talking about

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.805
one crucial aspect of GRC, audits and assessments.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:18.120
They're crucial because they can absolutely

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.720
dictate the plans and responsibilities of you,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.880
your GRC teams, and operational security teams for an entire year.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.875
In this lesson, we'll talk about audits and assessments, and what they accomplish,

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:33.525
where they originate from,

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:38.380
and how successful organizations cope with the process.
