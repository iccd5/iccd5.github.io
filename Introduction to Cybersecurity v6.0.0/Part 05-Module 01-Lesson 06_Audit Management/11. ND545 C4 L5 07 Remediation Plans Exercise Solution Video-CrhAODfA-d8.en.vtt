00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
How would I fix this issue?

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:05.160
Well, if I didn't have the information already,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.990
I'd ask the assessor for

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.905
detailed information as to where the vulnerability might be found.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:16.485
I would also, if I didn't already know what cross-site scripting was or how to fix it,

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:19.500
lookup the vulnerability to find as much details as

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.660
necessary for me to clearly explain why it's important to fix,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.930
where to find the issue, and how to fix it.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.230
I then ask associated stakeholders if 15 days is enough time to fix

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.920
the issue as recommended by the assessor or if it's technically feasible.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.725
If for any reason the recommended remediation cannot be applied within 15 days,

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:49.835
I would ask the stakeholders to provide details on either a,

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:54.470
winner remediation might be applied or b,

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.450
a proposed mitigating control.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.080
Once agreed, I'd work with the stakeholders to develop

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.700
milestones and schedule check-in meetings to ensure everything stays on track.
