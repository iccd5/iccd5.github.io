00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
Letters like this are pretty common before an assessment is scheduled to kick off.

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.815
There are a number of things you should consider.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:12.780
Thinking back to our ideas about controlling and facilitating assessments,

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.315
there's some considerations that you should think through.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.450
First, do you know the scope of the assessment?

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:22.230
What is the system or area of business being assessed?

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.830
Do you fully understand the techniques that will be used to perform the assessment?

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.130
Is it a manual review, a technical assessment?

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.410
Will there be automated tools used?

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.125
What are your obligations to the assessor?

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.985
Do you need them to be more specific?

00:00:36.985 --> 00:00:39.750
Are these all the documents that are required?

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.540
There's a list in the letter,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.075
but does this represent the entire list?

00:00:44.075 --> 00:00:47.705
Also, will the assessor need access to other stakeholders?

00:00:47.705 --> 00:00:50.210
You need to answer that question to make

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.015
sure that you line up those stakeholders as appropriate.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:56.615
Finally, what should you expect for the results?

00:00:56.615 --> 00:01:00.570
What will the detail be and when will you receive it?
