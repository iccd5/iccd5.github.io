Congratulations, we made it to the last lesson, audits and assessments.

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:08.985
In this lesson, we talked about what audits and assessments accomplish,

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.645
where they originate from, and how to control them.

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.140
We also learned how successful organizations cope

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.440
with the process and deal with remediation plans.
