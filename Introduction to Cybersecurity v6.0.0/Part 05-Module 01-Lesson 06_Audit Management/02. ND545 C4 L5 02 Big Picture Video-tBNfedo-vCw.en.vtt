00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.505
We've called this section, Audit Management.

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:05.130
But I should clarify that we're really talking about

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.670
the process of being assessed in some way.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.695
There are historical connotations of the words audit and assessment.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:17.190
Audit, is really meant as an evaluation of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.910
whether processes and procedures are operating as expected.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.540
Assessment, really means an evaluation of whether

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.500
processes and procedures align with industry standards.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.955
But those two terms are often used interchangeably.

00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:36.620
There are other words like, examination or attestation,

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.265
they are also used when describing the audit or assessment of an organization.

00:00:41.265 --> 00:00:43.195
Although I will note,

00:00:43.195 --> 00:00:47.630
that attestation generally continues to carry the connotation,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.780
that it's the end product of an audit.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.575
Meaning that I'm assessing your organization,

00:00:53.575 --> 00:00:58.025
and then attesting that your process is aligned with that assessment.

00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.010
But for practical purposes in this section,

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.230
when I refer to audit management,

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.420
I again mean the collective process of being assessed in some way.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.635
The collective audits can originate in a number of ways,

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:15.010
but in general, they are linked to compliance.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:20.090
Here is why, formal compliance or certification of compliance with the standard,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.390
may require that an independent assessment and

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.845
attestation that you comply with some minimum amount of control objectives.

00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:30.770
Or you may choose to perform

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.340
a self-assessment to ensure that you're compliant with the standard even if

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.160
it's not required for compliance certification

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.315
or to test readiness for an upcoming compliance assessment.

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:46.240
Customers may be allowed contractually to perform audits against your environment.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.210
Finally, organizations may actually choose to have

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.670
an external assessment performed after a security incident occurs.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.165
As we noted before,

00:01:56.165 --> 00:02:01.850
compliance professionals spend a good deal of time managing these types of assessments.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.420
I mentioned that certain audits may be required to prove

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.755
compliance or certify our organization against the standard.

00:02:09.755 --> 00:02:13.550
Here are a couple of examples of when an audit might be required.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.000
If your organization processes credit cards and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.915
maintains a PCI DSS compliance certification.

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:24.290
Certification requires assessment, by

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.650
what's called a qualified security assessor, or QSA.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.320
A SOC 2, that certification requires assessment by an AICPA,

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.300
certified public accounting firm.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.360
Also, customers may be allowed contractually

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.555
to assess your organization against a particular standard,

00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:45.395
or require an independent assessment against some standard.

00:02:45.395 --> 00:02:47.720
Or some standards like high trust,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.080
which is geared toward the healthcare industry,

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.160
they allow you to perform your own self-assessment prior to certification.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.545
We've already talked about some audits being required,

00:02:57.545 --> 00:03:00.994
meaning that if you don't have the assessment performed,

00:03:00.994 --> 00:03:04.610
you'll lose certification or fall out of compliance.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.285
So it's important to manage the audit process for that reason,

00:03:08.285 --> 00:03:12.575
to make sure you're having audits performed within the required time frames.

00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:15.430
But even if you're managing your audit schedule,

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.650
you still have to actively manage the audits.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.590
That means liaising between the auditor and

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.015
the organization to ensure questions are answered timely and accurately.

00:03:26.015 --> 00:03:27.815
In the worst case scenario,

00:03:27.815 --> 00:03:31.415
poorly managed audit could lead to loss of certification.

00:03:31.415 --> 00:03:33.350
In the best-case scenario,

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.165
poorly managed audit can lead to an organization scrambling to fix problems,

00:03:38.165 --> 00:03:41.710
and being consumed by fixing audit findings for a full year.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.740
Audits are designed to measure compliance with standards or best practices,

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:50.185
and uncover risk and control failure so that it can be remediated.

00:03:50.185 --> 00:03:52.740
The truth is, audits work.

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.939
But poorly managed audits can make it appear that an organization isn't in compliance,

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:04.175
is poorly managed, or lacks oversight sufficient for successful security organization.

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:06.245
I've seen assessments before,

00:04:06.245 --> 00:04:12.700
where inexperienced GRC professionals provided inaccurate and incomplete information.

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.159
Now based on that poor quality information,

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:20.195
the assessors found that the organization was nowhere near compliant.

00:04:20.195 --> 00:04:21.500
What they did find,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.175
is that the organization needed to address hundreds of findings,

00:04:25.175 --> 00:04:30.185
and the organizations spent months with more experienced GRC personnel,

00:04:30.185 --> 00:04:33.320
trying to track down the correct information and then

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.910
remediate findings that never truly existed.

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:42.485
Hundreds of findings, translates to at least hundreds of hours of human capital.

00:04:42.485 --> 00:04:46.000
The GRC personnel have to review the findings,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.129
they have to ask stakeholders to provide information,

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:52.100
review that information, and then finally,

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.695
provide those results in a digestible format back to the assessor.

00:04:56.695 --> 00:04:59.000
In the post incident audit,

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.850
the pitfalls can be even greater.

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.990
Typically, that's because you're now opening

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.970
your organization to an independent assessor without much constraint.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.765
In a normal audit,

00:05:08.765 --> 00:05:12.845
you will likely already have an ideas to what's going to be assessed,

00:05:12.845 --> 00:05:16.115
and you're going to provide the necessary information for that.

00:05:16.115 --> 00:05:18.880
But assessors don't tend to pull on threats.

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.035
In a post incident assessment,

00:05:21.035 --> 00:05:23.375
assessors will pull on every threat.

00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:27.815
The reason for that, is that your organization, during an incident,

00:05:27.815 --> 00:05:30.385
it didn't experience a single failure,

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:32.865
it experienced multiple failures.

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:35.780
Let's think about the Equifax breach for a moment.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:38.090
It's reported that bad actors used

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.025
a widespread web vulnerability to steal more than 140 million records.

00:05:43.025 --> 00:05:48.100
But a patch was released for that web vulnerability in March of 2017.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.125
Equifax failed to pass in a timely manner.

00:05:51.125 --> 00:05:52.820
That's one failure.

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:58.595
Then bad actors exploited their systems in May,

00:05:58.595 --> 00:06:01.950
but it wasn't noticed. That's another failure.

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:04.090
It wasn't noticed in June,

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.200
when the bad actors discovered a stockpile of personal information,

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.435
10 weeks later, the breach was finally detected.

00:06:11.435 --> 00:06:15.065
How many failures must have occurred between May and July?

00:06:15.065 --> 00:06:19.415
That's why these audits don't just focus on compliance with a single standard,

00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:23.185
but they focus on really exposing control and process failure.

00:06:23.185 --> 00:06:26.870
What's more, is organizational management

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.930
will be heavily involved in these types of assessments.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.375
I want to bring this back to compliance,

00:06:32.375 --> 00:06:37.085
and demonstrate why audit is necessary for just about every company today.

00:06:37.085 --> 00:06:39.710
We said that some compliance initiatives require

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:42.590
independent assessment to certify an organization.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:47.260
Others don't, but it's still a good idea to audit to get certain standards.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.530
Here's the reason why it's so important.

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:52.845
Certifying or self-certifying against a certain standard,

00:06:52.845 --> 00:06:55.909
gives you the ability to demonstrate to customers,

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:59.140
that your organization take security seriously.

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:04.130
Remember, we've already talked about how security is part of that trust assessment,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:08.090
that perspective customers use to evaluate you as a vendor.

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.790
The last thing you want,

00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:13.970
is for customers who have a contractual right to perform a security assessment,

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:17.530
to find threats or vulnerabilities that you're not aware of.

00:07:17.530 --> 00:07:20.300
That can create the risk of customer loss,

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:23.870
or having to deal with endless remediation efforts,

00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:26.940
just to satisfy that one customer.
