00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
We've talked a good deal about what audits are,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.115
how they originate, and their goals.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:10.530
We've also briefly touched on a few reasons as to why managing audits is so important.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.305
I'd like to drill down on that here.

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:19.570
As GRC professionals, you have a responsibility to facilitate and control audits,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.730
because it helps reduce risk.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.990
It does that by ensuring auditors have

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.454
a complete view of your security posture and your controls,

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:31.380
it helps to protect your compliance standing or

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.665
certification with certain compliance standards.

00:00:34.665 --> 00:00:37.830
Something that's related to protecting certification,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:40.860
it ensures that your audit results are consistent.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.250
You never want audit findings to vary

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.610
wildly from year to year or from assessment to assessment,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.160
it makes it difficult to understand where your true failures might actually be.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.940
Controlling the assessment might also mean helping your company avoid scope creep,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.630
or making sure that only what needs to be audited gets audited.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.880
I'll talk about this in a little bit more detail in just a moment.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.270
Finally, facilitation helps reduce unnecessary failure,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.610
meaning that your assessment results reflect

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.420
only findings that are real weaknesses or control failures.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.505
Let's take an even closer look,

00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:20.855
why is it important that we do all of these things?Reduce failure,

00:01:20.855 --> 00:01:23.065
avoid scope, creep, etc.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:25.685
There's a delicate balance in audit.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:31.145
On one side, you have a duty to answer assessor questions with integrity,

00:01:31.145 --> 00:01:32.825
on the other side,

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:36.460
you have a duty to protect the interests of the business.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.070
In most cases, your goal is either to gain

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.750
compliance or get through with these fewer findings as possible,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.725
demonstrating that your organization has a strong security program.

00:01:48.725 --> 00:01:54.140
So every step you take in controlling an assessment helps get you closer to that goal,

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.310
but you must provide complete and accurate information to the assessor.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.290
We talk about this as providing your best honest answer,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.525
best answer for the company, well,

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:07.790
honestly answering an assessors questions.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.945
Now that we understand the conflict that GRC professionals deal with,

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:15.685
let's talk about how to facilitate an assessment versus controlling it.

00:02:15.685 --> 00:02:20.485
Facilitating meaning that an assessor gets what they need while controlling it,

00:02:20.485 --> 00:02:23.255
meaning that you create some guard rails.

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:25.200
Let's start with control.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.850
The reason I start with control is because you have to understand

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.245
the scoping of assessment long before you begin the facilitate it.

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:34.870
Let me give you an example.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.715
We talked about a customer assessment earlier,

00:02:37.715 --> 00:02:42.125
what's the first thing you should do if a customer asks you to perform an assessment?

00:02:42.125 --> 00:02:47.360
Without question, you need to understand if you're contractually obligated to allow it,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.085
and if you are, what scope is allowed.

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:51.875
Now point of fact,

00:02:51.875 --> 00:02:54.080
all of this work should have been done during

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.380
contract negotiations so that there aren't any surprises.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.005
But you'll probably need to look the contract up anyway, just to be sure.

00:03:02.005 --> 00:03:05.000
Anyhow, if a customer's contract allows

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.070
them to assess security for a specific product or service,

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.345
you can't allow them to assess outside of that scope.

00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:14.510
Because otherwise, they'll be assessing items

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.960
that don't affect them and they may not be familiar with,

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.075
and that assessment will drag on,

00:03:20.075 --> 00:03:25.360
speaking of which, you should always try to limit all of your assessments in time.

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.595
You don't want customers or other assessments to have

00:03:28.595 --> 00:03:32.465
unlimited chances to reassess or demand additional information,

00:03:32.465 --> 00:03:35.495
and here are some additional ways if you can control on it.

00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:38.795
I'd like you to review these when you have some additional time.

00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:41.405
If control is about placing guard rails,

00:03:41.405 --> 00:03:44.420
facilitation is about helping an assessor as much as

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.770
possible while keeping the organization informed and at ease.

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.935
Your goal was to provide the best information possible,

00:03:51.935 --> 00:03:57.000
and there's only a handful of things that you need to do that we'll: First,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.890
create a project plan so that you understand the assessment schedule,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.765
and you can line up technology and people resources ahead of time.

00:04:04.765 --> 00:04:08.405
Ask for assessment questions and expectations early,

00:04:08.405 --> 00:04:11.930
so you're not trying to chase down resources last minute.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.050
Be engaged, staying engaged will help you guide

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:18.265
the assessment and reduce the chance for conflict.

00:04:18.265 --> 00:04:23.000
Fully understand the scope to ensure the assessment doesn't veer off track,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.835
and then finally, ensure that there's a successful transfer of information.

00:04:27.835 --> 00:04:31.670
To make sure your control assessments go the right way,

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.310
it's a good idea for organizations to agree on

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:38.670
some pre-assessment rules of engagement and then create some checklists.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.730
Those checklists can help reduce

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.870
institutional knowledge by giving every GRC employee a starting point,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.270
if they become responsible for managing

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.050
an audit and they'll help reduce friction with IT and

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.230
security operations staff by making sure that you're

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:58.739
providing the best information available about upcoming assessments.
