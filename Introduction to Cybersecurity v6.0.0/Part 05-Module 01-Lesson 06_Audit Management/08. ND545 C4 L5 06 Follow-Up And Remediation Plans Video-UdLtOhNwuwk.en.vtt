00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.830
Throughout this lesson, I've talked about findings.

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:05.910
Let me take just a moment and explain what I mean by that.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.220
Remember that at a high level,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.370
the goal of an audit relates to exposing weaknesses

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.535
or failures in your information security systems,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:18.130
proving compliance, setting budget, and etc.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.560
But the weaknesses or threats that are exposed and suggestions made by

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.855
the assessor during the audit process are what we're referring to as findings.

00:00:27.855 --> 00:00:31.290
Those audit findings operate similarly to how

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:34.920
risk registers or governance findings might operate.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.565
There will be a finding or a risk statement,

00:00:37.565 --> 00:00:40.130
an assessment of the risk by the assessor,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.370
and a recommendation of how to remediate the risk.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.890
But assessors will generally only provide

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.420
the actual findings and not a complete outcome for everything assessed.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.330
If many controls successfully passed an audit,

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.240
there's going to be little mention of those in the report,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.305
except maybe perhaps in a very brief statement in an executive summary.

00:01:01.305 --> 00:01:06.350
The only real cognizable difference between the audit report findings and those from

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.380
internal activities will be that risk ratings will

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.935
likely come with recommended time frames for remediation.

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:17.075
You absolutely want to keep a close eye on what those time frames are.

00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:19.100
One of the reasons you want to pay

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.010
such close attention to recommendations for remediation and

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.000
their associated time frames is organizations will

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.420
typically issue management responses to findings.

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.080
This is your opportunity to respond to an assessor.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.100
Normally, you'll respond in one of three ways.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.170
First, you'll agree with the finding and the recommendations for remediation,

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.120
or you'll partially agree with the finding or the recommendations,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.710
modifying the finding to suit your view of the organization's needs,

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.010
or you'll disagree with the finding and cite

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.280
some reason as to why you believe the finding misrepresents

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.500
your control or how it misrepresents

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.220
your associated risk or the recommendations for remediation.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:08.120
Plans of action following audits operate

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.090
just like plans of actions that we've discussed previously.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.350
As always, you'll want to involve the appropriate stakeholders to

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.350
negotiate timing or response and specific control adjustments.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.320
You'll want to keep track of all of those remediation activities so that

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.280
you're able to report status to leadership and make adjustments as necessary.
