00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.935
To complete this course,

00:00:01.935 --> 00:00:06.060
you will apply what you've learned to a common GRC scenario.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:10.365
Many GRC professionals walk into situations with

00:00:10.365 --> 00:00:17.445
immature GRC programs and they were hired to come in and mature those programs quickly.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:21.990
In fact, they may have been hired following a significant security of

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.850
it or an anticipation of a rapidly approaching assessment.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.125
In this project, that's exactly the situation you will face.

00:00:31.125 --> 00:00:38.439
You'll walk into a growing company needing to react fast to solve common GRC problems.
