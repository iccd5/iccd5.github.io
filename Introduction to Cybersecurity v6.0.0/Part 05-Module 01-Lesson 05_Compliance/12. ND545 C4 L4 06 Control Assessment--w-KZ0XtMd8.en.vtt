00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.955
Now, that you understand obligations,

00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:05.490
and how to understand control objectives,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.165
let's turn the one of the main priorities for the compliance professional,

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:12.210
evaluating your organization's controls.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.040
We went through the whole process of learning how to understand control objectives,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.430
so that we could measure our controls against them.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.530
Very much like risk assessment,

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.470
your organization should keep a risk register of

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.980
your control objectives and what compliance obligations they

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.040
originate from and then you should be able to line up

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.145
your existing security controls against those control objectives.

00:00:36.145 --> 00:00:39.810
Then we'll evaluate your control similarly to how we did

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.430
in governance in terms of function and time,

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.920
but without all of the extra considerations.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.100
Let's look at how you, actually,

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.530
evaluate your controls against objectives.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.720
Here's an example objective.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.830
Our control says, "Firewall rules must

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.745
be continuously monitored for unauthorized changes."

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:05.750
Our control says, that the security team reviews

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.270
firewall logs one time per week to look for unapproved changes.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.850
Now, does our control meet the control objective in both function and time?

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.525
We're reviewing the logs,

00:01:19.525 --> 00:01:21.555
we're meeting the function.

00:01:21.555 --> 00:01:23.160
What about time?

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.010
We're not really monitoring continuously.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.265
What do you think we, actually, need here?

00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:31.000
It's probably something more automated.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.115
Let's spend a few minutes on common controls.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:39.050
A common control is a single control that meets multiple objectives.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:41.740
Let's take a look at an example here.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.235
You have two control objectives.

00:01:44.235 --> 00:01:47.090
The first one says, that "Firewall rules must

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.410
be continuously monitored for unauthorized changes."

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.440
The second objective says,

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.860
that "Firewall rules must be monitored for changes at least weekly."

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.025
Now, let's look at our existing controls.

00:02:01.025 --> 00:02:04.480
Does Control 1 meet the objectives?

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.910
Control 1 says, "The security team reviews

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.275
firewall logs one time per week to look for unapproved changes."

00:02:12.275 --> 00:02:16.345
So it probably does not meet both objectives.

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:19.025
It probably meets the second objective,

00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:20.750
but not the first.

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.570
What about the second control?

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.150
The second control says,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.360
"The security team is alerted anytime a firewall change is made,

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.180
and they review the alerts immediately."

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.800
If we do this,

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.650
it probably meets both objectives.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.970
It covers us for monitoring at unspecified intervals, and continuous monitoring.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.065
Now finally, there are compensating controls.

00:02:48.065 --> 00:02:53.270
These are controls that don't necessarily meet the letter of a compliance obligation,

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.820
but may meet the spirit at least

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.515
sufficient enough to remain in compliance with the standard.

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:05.710
The idea being that the controls compensate for not having specific controls.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.110
Let's take a quick look at an example of this.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.240
Let's look at our control objective,

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.970
"Users should not be allowed to access

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.995
the Internet in order to prevent unauthorized data sharing."

00:03:17.995 --> 00:03:20.030
Our company doesn't do that,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.510
but we do have two other controls in place.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.930
Control 1 says, that "User Internet activity

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.805
is strictly controlled by using web filtering software."

00:03:30.805 --> 00:03:32.910
Then Control 2 says,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.810
that "Endpoint data loss prevention clients are

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.010
installed on computers that prohibit data sharing via the Internet."

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.075
While this isn't exactly what the objective wants,

00:03:44.075 --> 00:03:48.310
these controls may be sufficient to remain compliant.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:52.910
But typically, you're going to need an external assessor to help you make

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.310
the decision as to whether or not these controls

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.220
truly compensate for the control objective.
