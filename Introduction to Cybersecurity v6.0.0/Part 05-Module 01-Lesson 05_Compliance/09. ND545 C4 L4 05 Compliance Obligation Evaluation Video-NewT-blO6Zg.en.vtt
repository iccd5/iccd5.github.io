00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.260
Let's talk about evaluating our compliance obligations.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.485
Now, when I'm thinking about doing this evaluation,

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:09.930
whether it's a standard or regulation, law,

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.760
contract, what have you,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.425
I like to think about breaking down the control objectives to their simplest form.

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:19.650
I do this by thinking about Boolean logic.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.105
Boolean, of course, generally representing a binary variable,

00:00:24.105 --> 00:00:26.535
true or false, on or off.

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:30.420
That's the reason I think about control objectives in that way.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.270
I want to know exactly what my organization must

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.240
do without any of the pretense or extraneous language.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.765
Let me give you an example.

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:41.300
What are the steps that you need to play basketball?

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.975
First, before we get to the steps,

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:48.575
your control objectives will always have a subject.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:50.930
You have to find that subject.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.295
In this example, the subject is playing basketball.

00:00:56.295 --> 00:00:58.695
That's our actual objective.

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:02.750
Then we'll say that there are three initial steps to playing basketball.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.015
You have to buy a basketball,

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:09.115
pump it up, and spend some time dribbling it.

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:13.815
In Boolean search, there four operative search terms.

00:01:13.815 --> 00:01:16.415
There's AND, there's NOT,

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:19.775
there's OR, and there's AND NOT.

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:23.170
That's the lens that I want to look at our example through.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.400
If I want to play basketball,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.460
I have to do all three.

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:35.830
Meaning, buy the basketball and pump it up and dribble it or doesn't work here.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.915
Can I buy a basketball or pump it up?

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.860
No, that wouldn't be compliant with our statement.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.605
Let's look at a more real-world example.

00:01:45.605 --> 00:01:49.130
Here's an extract from the 14 Cloud Security Principles.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.890
This is a little more wordy than our last example,

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.410
but Section 5.2 spells out,

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.130
what service providers must do related to

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.430
vulnerability management and the goals that they must

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.195
accomplish in order to become compliant.

00:02:05.195 --> 00:02:08.245
These are control objectives.

00:02:08.245 --> 00:02:11.730
Let's try to get at this with a more Boolean approach.

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.230
Section 5.2 says that service providers should have

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.010
a management process in place to identify,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.895
triage, and mitigate vulnerabilities.

00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:23.970
What's in our subject?

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.945
It says that we have to have management processes.

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:29.240
That's a pretty good place to start.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:32.465
But these aren't just any management processes,

00:02:32.465 --> 00:02:35.015
they're ones that identify, triage,

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:38.975
and mitigate vulnerabilities, so we should include that as well.

00:02:38.975 --> 00:02:42.580
Then we've got to move to our control objectives.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.700
These are the goals.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.560
Each of the bullet points here represents its own goal.

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.485
Here we actually see three of those.

00:02:51.485 --> 00:02:56.695
Knowing that each bullet point represents its own control objective,

00:02:56.695 --> 00:02:58.865
let's look at the first two,

00:02:58.865 --> 00:03:01.400
starting with the first control objective.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.665
What's it really asking for?

00:03:03.665 --> 00:03:08.720
Remember, we said that our subject was a management process that identifies,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.780
triages, and mitigates vulnerabilities.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.790
I've rewritten the first objective here just to indicate that we have

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:23.045
a management process that identifies potential new threats, vulnerabilities, and etc.

00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:25.600
That's one control objective.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.260
Now, same thing with the second one.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.160
I've written it here to make it clear that

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.875
the second control objective is a separate objective altogether.

00:03:35.875 --> 00:03:39.640
Are you required to do one or both of these?

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.045
There really is no language indicating that you have a choice between the two.

00:03:44.045 --> 00:03:46.355
To meet the latter of this section,

00:03:46.355 --> 00:03:50.845
you must meet the first control objective and the second.

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:53.375
Now let's complicate this just a bit.

00:03:53.375 --> 00:03:55.415
What if we had another option?

00:03:55.415 --> 00:03:59.180
What if we could hire a company to manage these for us?

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.970
This really means that we can meet

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.640
this control objective by either doing the first two items,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:11.360
one and two, or the third.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.850
We've talked a lot about how governance

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.375
professionals evaluate obligations and control objectives.

00:04:17.375 --> 00:04:21.590
But what happens when a security obligation is non-specific?

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:26.860
Meaning, there aren't control objectives that detail security expectations.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:30.919
It's pretty common. Not every obligation is specific.

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.085
Here's an example of something you might see.

00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:38.795
Vendors must maintain an information security management system

00:04:38.795 --> 00:04:41.710
that aligns with industry best practices.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.555
What would you do in a case like this?

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:49.850
Typically what you want to do is just do your best and be able to provide

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.510
some reasoning as to why what you're doing complies with the spirit of this statement.

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:59.570
A great way to do that is to examine some best practices and

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.785
other standards to design a control or program that works for your organization.

00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:10.655
If you can explain that you've examined three separate standards, for instance,

00:05:10.655 --> 00:05:13.789
and that your program is based on those standards,

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:16.710
you're probably in pretty good shape.
