00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
You've made it to the compliance lesson in this course.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.240
Compliance is oftentimes what folks think

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.630
of when they think about governance, risk, and compliance.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.855
You'll see why, as we move throughout the course.

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.510
In this lesson, we'll discuss compliance.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.820
It's the final piece of the GRC puzzle.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.999
What's interesting about compliance is it's probably

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:24.300
the least flexible of all three GRC roles,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.775
meaning that your approach to compliance will likely be more structured.

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:31.520
We'll learn about that approach as we

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.535
look at some of the sources for compliance obligations,

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.350
how we evaluate those obligations.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.050
Then finally, we'll discuss how

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.500
an organization's obligations intersect with security controls in control assessments.
