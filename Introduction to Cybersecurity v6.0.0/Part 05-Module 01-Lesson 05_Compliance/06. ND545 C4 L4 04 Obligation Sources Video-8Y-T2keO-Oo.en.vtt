00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.900
Before we talk about where compliance obligations come from,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:06.390
we have to talk about how your organization

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.720
becomes connected to those obligations in the first place.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.555
What's the nexus? In general,

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:17.070
there are three ways that an organization can become attached to an obligation.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.565
First, by something that you already do.

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:24.930
This is what most individuals think about when discussing compliance.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.980
This is when a business is engaged in a particular activity which

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.720
causes the requirement of meeting specific levels of compliance.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.360
For example, HIPAA, HITECH,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.750
PCI, DSS, FedRAMP or others.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.415
Then there are contracts.

00:00:41.415 --> 00:00:44.765
Through customer contracts or master service agreements,

00:00:44.765 --> 00:00:49.760
organizations may contract to live up to specific compliance frameworks

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.240
or other compliance obligations which are actually defined in those contracts themselves.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.345
Then finally, there's adoption.

00:00:57.345 --> 00:01:01.600
These are the things as an organization that you want to do.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.710
Organizations may choose to adopt certain compliance obligations in order to become

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.185
more attractive to potential customers or prior to entering a new phase of business.

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:16.225
This is very common in a service provider or SaaS model.

00:01:16.225 --> 00:01:20.390
For instance, HIPAA is a US healthcare standard.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.120
What happens though if your organization wants to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.955
start processing healthcare data in France next year?

00:01:25.955 --> 00:01:30.670
Is there a different compliance obligation that you'd need to live up to?

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.355
Let's set aside contractual obligations for just a moment.

00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:38.885
As it relates to business requirements and adoption of compliance obligations,

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:41.090
many of these do come from laws or

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.740
regulations directed in an industry or a business activity.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.280
But many of them are also standards developed

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.135
by industry consortium's. Here's some examples.

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:57.430
Let's think about obligations required by your business activities.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.820
These are specific to an industry or an activity like PCI,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.175
which relates to payment card processing,

00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:08.425
this standard is created by a payment card consortium.

00:02:08.425 --> 00:02:14.075
It's not a law. Or there's HIPAA which relates to US healthcare and healthcare records.

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:16.490
This is a US regulation.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.605
In terms of adopting compliance obligations as I said before,

00:02:21.605 --> 00:02:26.000
you can adopt anything you want but it's typically done in or a

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.650
new business or prove that you have some minimum level of security control.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.490
Maybe for instance, your business wants to start processing credit cards.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.180
You'd probably want to adopt PCI before you

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.345
get to the time when you actually start processing credit cards.

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:45.665
But you can adopt general control standards as well.

00:02:45.665 --> 00:02:52.105
One's not tied to a specific business activity like ISO 27001 for instance.

00:02:52.105 --> 00:02:54.440
A standard like this is used to make

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.655
your business more attractive to prospective customers.

00:02:57.655 --> 00:02:59.625
Why does all of this matter?

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:02.930
Saying that you're compliant with a standard or certifying that you're

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.695
compliant can create tremendous business advantages.

00:03:06.695 --> 00:03:09.805
Take for example, a SOC 2 assessment.

00:03:09.805 --> 00:03:12.920
A SOC 2 is used to assess

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.590
existing security controls to ensure that they're

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.530
functioning as the organization expects.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.940
A SOC 2 certification must be performed by a certified accounting firm and

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.600
a SOC 2 certification serves as

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.400
a barrier to entry for most Software as a Service providers.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.965
What I mean is a SaaS provider if you don't maintain a SOC 2,

00:03:35.965 --> 00:03:39.500
it can be difficult to gain customers because it's really become

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.300
recognized as an absolute minimum bar.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.685
Then there are more direct negative consequences.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:49.070
In some cases, not being compliant with

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.765
the standard can create direct penalties for compliance.

00:03:52.765 --> 00:03:55.700
The payment card industry consortium for instance,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.455
can fine you for processing credit cards without being PCI certified.

00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:02.825
Or in the case of HIPAA,

00:04:02.825 --> 00:04:05.690
the Department of Health and Human Services maintains

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.545
something that's generally referred to as the wall of shame.

00:04:09.545 --> 00:04:15.125
That lists companies who have been fined by the department for HIPAA violations.

00:04:15.125 --> 00:04:18.050
The largest fines are reserved for

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.865
those companies that show a willful neglect in complying with HIPAA.

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:26.270
Two of the more challenging tasks for compliance professional are 1,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:32.390
understanding what compliance obligations apply to an organization and then 2,

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.500
recommending which requirements the business may want to adopt.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.070
In a large part,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:41.540
that's a function of both experience working as a

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.850
compliance professional and then

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.885
also experience understanding the context of the business.

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:51.740
In the meantime, there's a lot of great information online about

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.470
compliance obligations as they relate to specific types of businesses.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.550
But I want to caution you here.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.515
It's always best to read the actual standards, regulations, etc.

00:05:03.515 --> 00:05:06.860
Even if I find a compelling article that I think breaks down

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.550
a compliance obligation really well by section,

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.995
I still want to read the actual text.

00:05:12.995 --> 00:05:18.730
The reason for that is that way I can ensure the obligation is right for my organization.

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.345
In addition to that,

00:05:20.345 --> 00:05:25.460
I want to make sure that I develop a deep understanding of what's in that obligation so

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.805
that I can establish myself as an expert in that document and that field.

00:05:30.805 --> 00:05:33.620
Then finally, it helps me avoid committing

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.180
the organization to something based on misleading claims.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:41.660
Meaning that a vendor or a software provider would say that

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:43.670
certain organizations must comply with

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.150
an obligation when perhaps they don't really need to.

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.695
Now for this reason,

00:05:48.695 --> 00:05:54.424
I actually say that about 80 percent of the compliance job is reading comprehension,

00:05:54.424 --> 00:05:57.320
because you've got to establish yourself as

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:01.970
an expert with each obligation that your organization should meet.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.610
Finally, speaking of reading,

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.310
let's spend a few minutes on contracts.

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.980
Contract language has pretty quickly

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.250
become a hefty task for most compliance professionals.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:18.740
Here's why, your customers have to comply with certain security obligations

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.440
themselves and they want to make sure that

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.330
their entire ecosystem including their vendors, are secure as well.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.970
Now a big part of the reason for that is because of

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:32.165
the high profile breaches that we see like the target breach,

00:06:32.165 --> 00:06:35.135
which originated via a vendor.

00:06:35.135 --> 00:06:38.660
So now you have more and more customers writing

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:44.275
contract language to ensure that their vendors live up to their security expectations.

00:06:44.275 --> 00:06:47.600
Our legal departments are actually turning to

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.250
compliance professionals to interpret the security language for them.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:55.960
Now, normally, that language shows up in three ways.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.309
There can be specific provisions,

00:06:58.309 --> 00:07:02.570
meaning there's a language in the contract that spells out a behavior

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:07.295
like you must audit firewall logs one time per week.

00:07:07.295 --> 00:07:10.730
Or there can be a rider which might refer to

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:15.394
another document altogether that then spells out specific behaviors

00:07:15.394 --> 00:07:20.540
or the contract might spell out or dictate that you

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.955
comply with a specific obligation like ISO 27001 for example,

00:07:25.955 --> 00:07:27.830
or HIPAA for example.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.285
Now what happens if you choose not to do what the customer asks?

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.055
Well the consequences are,

00:07:34.055 --> 00:07:35.695
you might lose customers.

00:07:35.695 --> 00:07:38.855
They may choose to work with another vendor altogether.

00:07:38.855 --> 00:07:43.220
Or if you commit to something and fail to follow through,

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:46.639
there may be additional contract provisions for fines,

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:50.520
remediation schedules, or contract termination.
