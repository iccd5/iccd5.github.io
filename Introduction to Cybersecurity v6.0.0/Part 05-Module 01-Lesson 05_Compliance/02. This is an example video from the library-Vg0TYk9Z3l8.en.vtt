00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.775
Let's put a little context around compliance.

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:08.580
If you think back to how we said that GRC goals roughly equate to organizational roles,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.945
you'll remember that I said compliance equates to being trustworthy.

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:14.820
At a more micro level,

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.870
it means that we're doing the things that we should be doing as a company,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.645
that we're following through on our obligations.

00:00:21.645 --> 00:00:24.210
Because of that, there tends to be

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.080
a legal connotation surrounding the practice of compliance,

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.265
and many of our obligations do stem from law or regulation.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:37.485
But obligations don't have to be legal obligations.

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:40.425
They don't always originate fear of the law.

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:42.680
Our obligations do however,

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.715
tie directly back to security controls.

00:00:45.715 --> 00:00:49.130
We meet our obligations via controls.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.700
Finally, I said that compliance functions tend to be less flexible.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.870
What I mean by that is that compliance is mostly a binary function.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.130
You either align with compliance obligations or you don't,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:02.900
with a few caveats.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.055
Now, where did security compliance come from?

00:01:06.055 --> 00:01:08.240
Much earlier in this course,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.940
we talked about poor business practices, fraud,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.415
and failure, combining to give life to what we described as operational GRC.

00:01:16.415 --> 00:01:19.460
If you recall, we start to see

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.785
operational GRC practices in earnest over the last 30 years or so.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:29.510
There are two other forces that are starting to emerge at the same time.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.055
One of those forces is technology acting as a business driver.

00:01:34.055 --> 00:01:36.530
Business is really just beginning

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.825
the early stages of their Cloud journeys and digital transformation.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:46.665
The second force is security as a technology enabler.

00:01:46.665 --> 00:01:51.755
Maybe more accurately, the disabling of bad actors.

00:01:51.755 --> 00:01:55.130
Because technology becomes integral to business,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.690
bad actors flock to technology as a primary attack vector.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.250
Security then becomes necessary to protect technology,

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.070
ensuring operations, avoiding breaches, and avoiding fraud.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.445
This becomes the root of security compliance.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:15.815
Security, as we've said,

00:02:15.815 --> 00:02:21.200
is a collection of processes and technologies designed to protect the confidentiality,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.895
integrity, and availability of technology and data.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:30.320
Of course, the force of security is really a push to expand protections or

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.745
controls to all areas of the business which are now supported by technology.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:39.435
It's a fairly straightforward concept.

00:02:39.435 --> 00:02:44.580
Security protects technology or data and technology enables business.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:48.725
Therefore, as business grows and technology grows,

00:02:48.725 --> 00:02:51.775
so must our security implementation.

00:02:51.775 --> 00:02:57.665
There's a recognition about security becoming a necessary element of business operations,

00:02:57.665 --> 00:03:00.770
and these forces begin to bleed into regulation.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.700
You really start to see the impact of that at the turn of the century.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.040
Here's an example. Now, we touched on Sarbanes-Oxley earlier.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:16.040
To remind you, Sarbanes-Oxley is US legislation passed in 2002.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.620
It's indirect response to corporate fraud from the late '90s to the early 2000s.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.255
I want us to look just a little closer at two specific sections of that act.

00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:31.245
The first section is Section 302.

00:03:31.245 --> 00:03:34.380
This section holds senior officers and

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.545
public companies accountable for ensuring financial statements are accurate.

00:03:39.545 --> 00:03:42.490
Now, let's talk about Section 404.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:49.085
Section 404 relates to internal controls and management assessment of those controls.

00:03:49.085 --> 00:03:51.410
In large financial institutions,

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:57.475
in order to certify accuracy of financial information and verify internal controls,

00:03:57.475 --> 00:03:59.280
what do you think that means?

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.915
What does that mean today?

00:04:00.915 --> 00:04:05.860
We're really going to have to look at the technology that supports the business.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.740
Ultimately, if we want to ensure the integrity of the data,

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:15.565
that means ensuring that security controls are in place and functioning as expected.

00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:19.640
So today, Section 404 operates as

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.215
an IT and security control assessment for banks and public companies.

00:04:24.215 --> 00:04:25.804
If you want to be compliant,

00:04:25.804 --> 00:04:28.330
you must comply with those standards.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:29.930
The goal, of course,

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.780
is to create security standards that organizations

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.975
must comply with to protect the common good.

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:41.690
If large organizations or banks are failing because of fraud or security failure,

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.985
it might hurt lots of individuals.

00:04:44.985 --> 00:04:49.220
It's not just large public companies or the financial sector,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.585
believe it or not,

00:04:50.585 --> 00:04:53.810
other industries have also figured out that forcing

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.805
organizations to comply with some minimal standard reduces risk.

00:04:58.805 --> 00:05:01.670
So practically speaking, no company and

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:07.160
no industry is immune from understanding and dealing with security compliance.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.440
This is where compliance comes from.
