00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
It's probably safe to say that the goal of

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.960
the security compliance function is to be compliant.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.150
What does it mean to be compliant?

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.970
It means that you're meeting some obligation or living up to some expectation.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.005
For example, you must watch this video in

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:23.520
order to complete the GRC course.If you watch this video,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.160
you're in compliance with this statement,

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.685
or more specific to security.You

00:00:29.685 --> 00:00:34.005
must have a firewall that blocks unnecessary ingress traffic.

00:00:34.005 --> 00:00:37.080
Ingress, of course, meaning incoming traffic,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.405
if you have that, you comply.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:42.405
Let's drill down on the word obligation.

00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:45.125
It's used to represent just a couple of things.

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.170
There's what I'll describe as the big obligation,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:54.905
meaning the top-level sources of compliance or the document level.This is Sarbanes-Oxley,

00:00:54.905 --> 00:00:58.605
this is HIPAA, this is ISO 27001.

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:02.375
Then there's what I'll describe as the little obligation,

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.210
meaning the low-level items within

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.085
the documents that specify a particular action or control.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:12.950
These are the sentences or clauses within the document.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.045
Like for instance, you must have an eight character password.

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:20.074
These are also called control objectives,

00:01:20.074 --> 00:01:22.475
and to try to avoid confusion,

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:26.720
I'm going to call the top-level documents obligations,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.234
and then I'll try to call the lower-level statements control objectives.

00:01:31.234 --> 00:01:34.920
We're going to talk about how these relate to your organization soon.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.170
But for now, know that the goal of security compliance is to meet

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:44.200
specific control objectives to be compliant with obligations.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.355
Here's an obligation example.

00:01:46.355 --> 00:01:50.405
Take what's referred to as the 14 cloud security principles.

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:54.950
This is a standard published by the UK National Cyber Security Center that

00:01:54.950 --> 00:02:00.325
provides guidance for companies that wish to do business with UK federal departments.

00:02:00.325 --> 00:02:04.845
The published standard is the top-level obligation,

00:02:04.845 --> 00:02:10.415
and the clauses are the low-level obligations or control objectives.

00:02:10.415 --> 00:02:11.995
So in this case,

00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:14.490
the control objective in Section 1,

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.220
recommends that you must deploy TLS as

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.405
the primary data in transit protection for exposed interfaces from your service.

00:02:23.405 --> 00:02:26.590
Now, that we know what we're complying with,

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.510
let's look at how we comply.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.420
Compliance can mean a number of things.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.940
There's meeting the latter of an obligation.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.915
Meaning you've gone through assessed every control objective,

00:02:37.915 --> 00:02:42.145
and made sure that your organization does exactly as prescribed.

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:45.130
Does that mean that you're in compliance?

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.835
Probably, but maybe not different high-level compliance objectives

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:54.295
may require that you prove your compliance in different ways.

00:02:54.295 --> 00:02:57.860
One of those ways is independent assessment,

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.860
meaning that an auditor or assessor examines

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.805
your organizations controls against the compliance objective.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:08.000
If you followed the obligation to the letter,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.420
then you'll theoretically meet the expectations of the assessor

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.575
and you'll be deemed compliant or certified.

00:03:15.575 --> 00:03:18.115
There's also self-certification.

00:03:18.115 --> 00:03:24.365
Other compliance obligations may allow you to self-certify or assert your compliance.

00:03:24.365 --> 00:03:27.980
So if you've gone through every control objective and insured,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.525
your organization meets them,

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:32.605
you could say that you are compliant with that standard.

00:03:32.605 --> 00:03:37.580
HIPAA, for instance, doesn't have an actual compliance certification,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.810
but many organizations say they are HIPAA compliant.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:44.345
Finally, there are some exceptions.

00:03:44.345 --> 00:03:48.395
It is possible to be compliant with an obligation without,

00:03:48.395 --> 00:03:50.600
actually, being fully compliant.

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.290
In certain cases, a compliance obligation may

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.980
allow organizations to claim compliance if they meet

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.850
a measure like a percentage or otherwise of

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:07.535
certain controls or have in place what we describe as compensating controls.

00:04:07.535 --> 00:04:10.295
Controls that aren't a hundred percent in line,

00:04:10.295 --> 00:04:13.550
but do mitigate the risk in some way that are

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.000
intended to be satisfied by the given control objective.
