00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.075
Remember from previous videos that passwords are a poor way to prove someone's identity.

00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:08.550
They're easily shared, written down,

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.510
and often leaked plus there are so many to remember.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.110
The solution is to use a password manager.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.070
Password managers are encrypted vaults that hold your passwords,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.250
so you don't need to memorize them or write them down.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.319
Besides keeping your identity,

00:00:25.319 --> 00:00:27.375
credentials, and sensitive data safe,

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:31.260
a password manager can generate strong unique passwords to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.864
ensure you aren't reusing them across your devices, websites, and services.

00:00:35.864 --> 00:00:38.760
This way you can use a much longer, complex,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.925
and ultimately more secure password.

00:00:41.925 --> 00:00:43.880
An additional benefit with

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.050
many password managers is that you can use multi-factor authentication,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.630
or MFA with them.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.990
Common password management applications include LastPass,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.135
Keepass, 1password, and Dashlane.

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:01.250
Some of these are free and some may require

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:06.335
paid subscription and are quickly becoming the main part of security best practices.

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:11.150
The intent of this exercise was to give you the opportunity to test

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.210
a password manager to understand how it fits as a part of security best practices.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.560
You'll have the further opportunity to use a password manager in a later exercise.
