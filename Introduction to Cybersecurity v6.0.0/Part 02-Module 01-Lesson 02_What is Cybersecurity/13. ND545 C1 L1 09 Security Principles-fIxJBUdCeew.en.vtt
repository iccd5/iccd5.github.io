00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
This video explains a set of security principles

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.255
that are the framework for all security programs.

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.270
These are basic ideas that are not specific,

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.535
just a cybersecurity or IT,

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:16.080
and are used to structure how we protect our technologies.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.110
Earlier I mentioned Saltzer and Schroeder paper,

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.270
The Protection of Information in Computer Systems, published in 1975.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.320
These are also known as the design principles for computer systems.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.130
To summarize, these principles are economy of mechanism,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.740
fail-safe defaults, complete mediation,

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:37.965
open design, separation of privilege, least privilege,

00:00:37.965 --> 00:00:41.765
least common mechanism, and user friendly interface.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:44.125
Let's see how a few of these work.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:50.225
Economy of mechanism is just a fancy word that means to keep things small and simple.

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:52.760
Bigger is not necessarily better,

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.744
it just means that there's more to protect and complexity is an enemy of security.

00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:02.105
Complex systems are harder to defend

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:05.510
because you need to understand all of the ways it works,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.175
how it can be accessed,

00:01:07.175 --> 00:01:11.150
and how it can be broken to allow unauthorized activities.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.840
To fail-safe means to anticipate how things can go

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.215
wrong and to ensure when it does things are in a safe state.

00:01:18.215 --> 00:01:21.385
This should be the default, not an exception.

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:26.315
To do this, you need to know how something may fail and plan for that failure,

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.170
which means failing smart.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.115
For an example, let us say you have a walk-in freezer and the power goes out,

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:36.785
should the freezer door lock?

00:01:36.785 --> 00:01:39.845
No, because it can lock someone inside.

00:01:39.845 --> 00:01:43.810
The freezer door needs to fail open by default.

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.470
Life safety is always priority number 1.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.365
In computer networks, if a network firewall fails,

00:01:51.365 --> 00:01:55.430
we want the website to be shut and not let anyone in.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.170
The website needs to fail shut by default.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.850
In computer networks, we need to decide if we

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.670
want our e-commerce website to be open to everyone,

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.435
should a network firewall fail or shut and not let anyone in.

00:02:08.435 --> 00:02:11.255
This is a business decision.

00:02:11.255 --> 00:02:15.080
Least privilege is a concept dealing with access control.

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.520
It means having the minimum privileges or permissions needed to do a job.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.025
Nothing more, nothing less,

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:25.760
too much and you could be blamed if there are problems.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.670
For example, I once worked for an executive who wanted his badge

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.590
to access any door in any building on the companies large campus.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.885
The problem is that if when he looses his badge,

00:02:38.885 --> 00:02:43.175
the person who finds it has access to all of the rooms.

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:47.560
Plus that executive always has an assistant to let him in any door.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.975
An example in computers is to not to use

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:55.639
an administrator superuser or root account unless you need it to install,

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.675
modify, or manage applications.

00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:01.670
If you use an administrator account as the default,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.535
it's a lot more likely your computer may be infected with a computer virus.

00:03:06.535 --> 00:03:11.745
The last two security principles I'll talk about are choke points and defense in depth.

00:03:11.745 --> 00:03:15.080
For this example, let's use a castle analogy.

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:18.100
So picture in your mind a castle.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.960
Think of the ways in or out, it's limited.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:25.340
There will be a main entrance that is heavily guarded,

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.240
any back entrances maybe restricted and would also be guarded.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.305
This is known as a choke point.

00:03:32.305 --> 00:03:35.150
We have the same idea on our computer networks,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.900
there's a main and root say to the Internet and

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.775
any back doors would be very limited to only known administrators.

00:03:43.775 --> 00:03:47.690
Castles are also known for having many layers of security

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.025
between the outside and the internal crown jewels.

00:03:52.025 --> 00:03:56.330
There are multiple walls or moats and other defenses in place.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:59.885
In computers, we also use layers of security.

00:03:59.885 --> 00:04:01.520
Think of your home network.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:05.070
You'll have your network switch that has a firewall and

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.350
the computer or device you use should also have multiple defenses in place,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.125
such as antivirus or endpoint protection.

00:04:12.125 --> 00:04:15.650
This is known as defense in depth and partnered with

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.970
a choke point are some of the principles of information security.
