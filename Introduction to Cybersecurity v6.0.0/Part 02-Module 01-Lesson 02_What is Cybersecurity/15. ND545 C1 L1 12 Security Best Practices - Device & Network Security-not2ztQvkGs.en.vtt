00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
Viruses, worms, Trojan horse applications, ransomware, spyware,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.725
and other forms of malicious software,

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:09.780
also known as malware,

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.595
continue to haunt us.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:14.490
Step 1 in protecting your device is to have

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.344
an antivirus application whenever they are available.

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:21.060
Many operating systems like Microsoft Windows

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.075
come with an antivirus or endpoint protection program.

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:25.860
For the Windows operating system,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.124
it's called Windows Defender.

00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:32.820
You can also purchase separate AV programmed for additional security.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.390
In the exercise, you'll get to explore a website you can

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.680
use to check files or web URLs for malware.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.820
Another simple way to protect your devices and applications on

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.645
them is to keep them up-to-date with patches.

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:50.000
This is basically fixing a known problem or

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.560
a software vulnerability by applying a new version of software.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.050
This will usually come from the software manufacturer.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.620
Microsoft first introduced the idea of Patch Tuesday in

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.885
2003 as a means to reduce costs associated with patch deployment.

00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:09.215
On the second, now sometimes fourth Tuesday of the month,

00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:11.630
Microsoft releases its updates.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.710
This makes them easier to schedule for systems administrators.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.670
Not all applications follow a rigorous schedule for patching.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.305
Whenever you can, set them to automatically update.

00:01:23.305 --> 00:01:27.065
Otherwise, you need to remember to install them yourself.

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:31.130
You'll experiment with patching in future exercises.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.810
The last security best practice I'll cover is protecting how you connect,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.125
also known as network security.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:39.860
Like many of the topics,

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.380
this is a class by itself.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.640
For this session, we'll focus on protecting wireless connections,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.070
since it's most often the way we connect when not on a desktop computer.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.494
First at home, we need to configure the Wi-Fi router or switch for security,

00:01:56.494 --> 00:02:01.675
which means using at least Wi-Fi protected access to or WPA2.

00:02:01.675 --> 00:02:06.575
If it's available, use the latest version known as Wi-Fi 6.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:10.010
This encrypts or scrambles the signal so

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.865
no one can eavesdrop on our network conversations.

00:02:13.865 --> 00:02:16.640
You also need to set a password to access

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.710
your routers configuration and your Wi-Fi signal known as the SSID.

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.025
This way, you can control who uses it when you're away from your home or office,

00:02:28.025 --> 00:02:31.985
know when and where your device is connecting to Wi-Fi networks.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.715
Be careful with open Wi-Fi,

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:38.255
often available in stores, restaurants, and airports,

00:02:38.255 --> 00:02:42.500
since others can sniff the airwaves for your activity,

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.935
basically watching you and what you're doing on the network.

00:02:45.935 --> 00:02:47.975
To be really safe,

00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:50.990
you should disable your devices Wi-Fi and Bluetooth,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.080
because you never know who's watching you.

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.080
These are just a few tips to get you started.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.265
We'll be going into a lot more details about them throughout the course.

00:03:01.265 --> 00:03:05.270
There are simple ideas to get you started to protect yourself,

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.060
your devices, and your networks.
