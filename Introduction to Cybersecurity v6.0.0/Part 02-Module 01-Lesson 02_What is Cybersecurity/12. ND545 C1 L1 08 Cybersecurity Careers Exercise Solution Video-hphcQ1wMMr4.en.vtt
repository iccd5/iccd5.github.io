00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
I'll now explain the solution to the cybersecurity careers exercise.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.930
To help close the cybersecurity skills gap,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.855
the CyberSeek websites provide detailed,

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:13.890
actionable data about supply and demand in the cybersecurity job market.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:17.580
From the website, you should have picked a role you would like to have.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.590
Let's look at how you would do that.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.960
You start out on the basic website and you can see the career pathway.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.910
On that website, you can see the different types of entry-level, mid-level,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.370
and advanced level jobs between cybersecurity technician,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.780
a cybercrime investigator, or an IT auditor.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.125
This also shows you potential career paths for each types of role.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:46.010
If you click on one, for example,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.770
cybersecurity specialist technician, you can see

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.925
the potential number of job openings and salary.

00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:53.825
When we scroll down,

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:57.560
we learn more such as the top skills requested,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.975
type of education required,

00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:05.270
job titles, and certifications requested for this type of role.

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.970
For example, for a role of systems engineer,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.340
common job titles include a system engineer,

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.150
system analyst, or IT business analyst.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:17.915
Certifications can include CompTIA Security plus,

00:01:17.915 --> 00:01:21.325
or Certified Information Security Manager.

00:01:21.325 --> 00:01:24.290
The intent of this exercise is for you to

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.995
understand different cybersecurity roles and the requirements to fill them.

00:01:27.995 --> 00:01:30.590
CyberSeek is a good resource to help you in

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.770
your journey for building your cybersecurity career.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.195
The second part of the exercise is for you to explore the CyberSeek's,

00:01:38.195 --> 00:01:41.015
cybersecurity supply-demand heat map.

00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:42.590
From the main site,

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.630
it's the interactive map.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.970
From here, you can see potential job openings for your state or metropolitan area.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.985
For example, California, over 72,000 jobs in cybersecurity alone.

00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:59.185
Colorado over 17,000.

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:02.205
To pick a state, let's look at California.

00:02:02.205 --> 00:02:05.030
We can see number of job openings,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.820
total employed in the cybersecurity workforce,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:14.245
the supply-demand ratio, different job titles, and certifications required.

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:18.200
Use the CyberSeek cybersecurity supply-demand heat map to

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.210
better understand how to build your cybersecurity career.
