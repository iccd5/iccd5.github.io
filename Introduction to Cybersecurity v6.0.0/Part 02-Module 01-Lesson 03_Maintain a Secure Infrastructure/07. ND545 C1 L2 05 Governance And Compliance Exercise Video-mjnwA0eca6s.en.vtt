00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.815
As you learned during the lesson,

00:00:01.815 --> 00:00:04.350
governance establishes authority management and

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.760
decision-making related to information systems and data.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:13.080
Policies set the rules all people need to follow or at least be aware of.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.450
In this exercise, you explored some of Udacity's policies on their legal website,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.400
udacity.com/legal and their terms of use.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.485
On their website, you can see they have numerous policies available for you to read.

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:30.165
Most likely you didn't read them,

00:00:30.165 --> 00:00:32.220
but they're there and I recommend you do.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.800
For example, the Terms of Use explains what

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.560
you're expected to do while using their websites.

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.735
Privacy Policy, what information can you Udacity collect about you.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:45.380
The Cookies, those are those little remnants when you're browsing.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.300
International and GDPR has to do with international privacy rules,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.115
and then how to give feedback.

00:00:52.115 --> 00:00:55.795
Let's look at their specific terms of use.

00:00:55.795 --> 00:01:01.045
The terms of use set the rules for using Udacity's websites and services.

00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:05.660
In particular, if you scroll down on Udacity's terms of service website,

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.940
you should pay attention to their services.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.620
These are the rights regarding their services.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.240
The access and user accounts section provides the definitions and requirements.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.155
Now, lets explore Udacity's privacy policy.

00:01:21.155 --> 00:01:23.555
On Udacity's privacy policy,

00:01:23.555 --> 00:01:26.710
note how they may use your information and what they collect.

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.890
You may also see how they use analytics as a part of their services.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:38.340
Lastly, review how they may share or disclose your user private information.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.600
Security and privacy professionals need to be very

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.635
knowledgeable about the different types of policies and how they are used.

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:50.790
I encourage you to explore Udacity's policies as examples.
