00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
The first function you looked at is identify,

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.140
determining and documenting your key business assets.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.770
If you don't know what you have, how can you protect it?

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.250
This category helps you figure out what technology, data,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.465
and other resources your company has that's valuable to you and others.

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:21.870
Some examples of this category include;

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.630
identifying physical and software assets,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.210
understanding your business environment,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.620
the policies you've established as part of your governance program,

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.100
how do you manage your risk management strategy?

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.800
Supply chain risks. In other words,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.670
what are entry points and exit points for information and data in your organization?

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.855
The idea here is to identify computers that have access to,

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:52.160
for example, our banks money and people's bank accounts.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.580
Now that you've identified your organization's key assets,

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.885
we can move to step 2 of the NIST CSF, protect.

00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:04.685
These are ways you can secure the items you identified in step 1.

00:01:04.685 --> 00:01:08.210
Ways to establish valid protection come in many forms,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.740
including non-technical human components such as security awareness.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.340
Other examples are technical products and services,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.630
acquiring some level of expertise such as firewalls on network security or web filters,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.770
malware and virus protection,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.790
patching and updating or encrypting the data so it's scrambled,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.310
whether it's in transit across the Internet,

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.980
or at rest within a database or a file share.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.180
Some examples of this include,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.470
protecting using identity management and access control,

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.300
teaching your employees through awareness and training,

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:49.635
establishing some data security protection.

00:01:49.635 --> 00:01:51.390
In other words within the bank,

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.250
not allowing everybody into the banks databases that may

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.020
contain the sensitive information about people's accounts whether they have money,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.125
and managing protective technology to ensure security resilience of computer systems.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:08.645
With these defenses in place,

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:13.730
you don't have to rely as much on the further functions within the nest framework,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.265
but they all tie together.

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:19.490
In the first two steps of the nest cyber security framework,

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.560
we identified critical assets and established controls to protect those assets.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.395
The third step, is to detect a real or potential incident as quickly as possible.

00:02:30.395 --> 00:02:35.155
This allows you to quickly and easily respond and recover.

00:02:35.155 --> 00:02:39.070
The detect function is defined as the development and implementation of

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.570
some type of an activity to identify the occurrence of a cyber security event,

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.510
which could be something that causes damage or

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.480
just is something you notice, like for example,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.705
a phishing attack against your organization,

00:02:52.705 --> 00:02:54.670
we see those all the time,

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.675
that can be an event, but if no one clicks on it or doesn't do any damage,

00:02:58.675 --> 00:03:01.470
it's not considered an incident.

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.370
Detects function also has the focus on assisting the appropriate finding of

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:12.440
such events and you need to determine what events to look for and identify them quickly.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.370
Some examples within the detect function,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.840
including ensuring these events and anomalies are detected,

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.035
knowing if there's any thresholds that are exceeded.

00:03:24.035 --> 00:03:25.430
Like you normally expect,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.290
say 500 people to hit your website daily and now you're seeing 50,000,

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.270
that should be an anomaly and you should understand why that is occurring.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.580
You should also implement continuous monitoring,

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.045
so this way you are always knowing what's happening on your systems,

00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:42.815
even in the middle of the night.

00:03:42.815 --> 00:03:45.445
Then maintaining your detection processes,

00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:48.560
this allow you to have an alarming place,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.975
like someone getting into the bank who shouldn't,

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:57.505
whether it's physically, or virtually meaning logically, through network sensors.

00:03:57.505 --> 00:03:59.465
Once you detect a problem,

00:03:59.465 --> 00:04:00.965
whether it's a security breach,

00:04:00.965 --> 00:04:03.920
network outage, or system misconfiguration,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.644
you need to respond.

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:10.535
This is your plan for handling incidents to ensure that their impact is minimal.

00:04:10.535 --> 00:04:15.590
Examples include; writing your incident response plan and

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.810
process and distributing it to your employees who will need to implement it.

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.770
Should there be some type of a disaster like a weather event,

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.150
or an attack against your infrastructure that takes it down.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.985
For example, a denial of service attack will stop your website from working.

00:04:33.985 --> 00:04:39.440
You want to be able to respond to it and get back to work as quickly as possible.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.065
Response also includes managing who communicates and an analysis of the event,

00:04:46.065 --> 00:04:49.640
and then mitigation activities that are performed afterward

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.740
to prevent the expansion of the event and to resolve the incident.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:57.515
By using the NIST CSF functions and categories,

00:04:57.515 --> 00:05:02.725
organizations experience fewer breaches and security compliance issues.

00:05:02.725 --> 00:05:04.940
After responding to an incident,

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.990
you may need to recover all or portions of your business.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:13.745
Step 5 of the nist cyber security framework is recovery.

00:05:13.745 --> 00:05:16.250
Getting your operations quickly back to normal,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.095
can lessen the financial and human costs of a cyber-security incident.

00:05:21.095 --> 00:05:23.285
The more resilient you are,

00:05:23.285 --> 00:05:27.190
the less your organization is impacted by the disruption.

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.220
Examples include; ensuring the organization implements

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.405
the recovery planning according to the document that should be written,

00:05:35.405 --> 00:05:40.055
tested, and you should have employees trained on your disaster recovery plans.

00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:44.060
Also means implementing improvement based on the lessons you

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:49.270
learned through your tests or real-world incidents.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.230
Then like the response,

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.070
you need to have appropriate internal and external communications,

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:58.970
both internally and externally to the organization.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.110
For example with the bank,

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.820
if you have a bank robber who broke the window trying to get in,

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.260
you would need to install a new window and maybe some bars.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.110
Within our computers, we may be looking to install new defenses,

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.795
or maybe re-installing systems.

00:06:15.795 --> 00:06:18.230
The NIST CSF functions,

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.010
categories and subcategories help us implement

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:27.540
security through all of the different areas of a cyber security program.
