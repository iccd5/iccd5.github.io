00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
In the maintaining a secure critical infrastructure lesson,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.010
you will evaluate specific security techniques used to

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.110
administer a system that meets industry standards and core controls.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.500
In this lesson, we start with governance and compliance.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.240
This is the high level planning and establishment of security rules.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.740
I'll also talk about the different laws, regulations, standards,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.105
and frameworks that provide oversight and direction for security programs.

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:33.770
The third area is about the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, or NIST CSF,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.330
which is a leading source of directions for cybersecurity programs of any size or type.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.285
The final area is the Center for Internet Security's Critical Security Controls.

00:00:46.285 --> 00:00:49.910
Each of these topics provides requirements for maintaining

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.065
an organization security within its critical infrastructure.

00:00:54.065 --> 00:00:55.925
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:55.925 --> 00:00:59.860
you'll be able to explain cybersecurity governance concepts.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.350
Apply methods to enforce cybersecurity governance.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.950
Identify common security regulations and frameworks.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.350
Explain how current security laws,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.805
regulations, and standards apply to cyber security and data privacy.

00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:17.825
Recognize components of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:24.290
Recognize components of the Center for Internet Security, Critical Security Controls
