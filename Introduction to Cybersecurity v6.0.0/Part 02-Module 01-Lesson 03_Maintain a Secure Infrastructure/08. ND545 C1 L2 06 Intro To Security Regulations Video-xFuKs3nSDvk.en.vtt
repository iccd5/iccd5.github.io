00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Every organization, no matter its size, structure,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.070
or sector has a governing body saying what security rules must be followed.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.440
These laws, regulations, standards,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.105
and frameworks provide oversight direction for security programs.

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:19.410
They supply a process for securing an organization's infrastructure.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.940
Many also have very specific rules or controls that must be followed.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.805
Security controls are specific safeguards or countermeasures to avoid,

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:33.524
detect, counteract, or minimize risks to assets.

00:00:33.524 --> 00:00:37.440
This topic helps you identify common security regulations and

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.100
frameworks that you will see as a cybersecurity professional.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.170
There are a handful of general security standards you need to

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.530
know about because you'll have to work with them in the real world.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.550
These cover any size or type of business.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.620
The ISO 27000 Series is a grouping

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.145
of international information security management models.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:03.060
The first document, ISO/IEC 27001,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.295
Information Security Management System Specification,

00:01:06.295 --> 00:01:09.080
provides high-level directions on establishing

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.370
security programs and assessing their security.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:19.825
The primary document you'll see in the series though is ISO/IEC 27002,

00:01:19.825 --> 00:01:24.394
the 2013, that just means the year in which it was last publish.

00:01:24.394 --> 00:01:28.620
This one is the code of practice for information security management,

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.410
and it provides direction on 14 security control groups and addresses

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:41.495
35 control objectives with more than 110 individual security rules or controls.

00:01:41.495 --> 00:01:47.825
Other ISO documents you may encounter includes ISO/IEC 27005,

00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:51.575
which is the Information Security Risk Management Standards.

00:01:51.575 --> 00:01:56.105
This explains how to assess and measure security risks.

00:01:56.105 --> 00:01:58.520
Another security standards you'll see is from

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.189
the National Institute of Standards and Technology,

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:04.565
or NIST Computer Security Resource Center.

00:02:04.565 --> 00:02:08.030
Their website is csrc.nist.gov.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.045
I can't encourage you enough to spend time there.

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:15.140
They provide resources including standards, practice guides,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.240
and requirement documents on computers,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.630
cyber, and information security, and privacy.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:27.934
In particular, the Special Publication or SP 800 series comprises guidelines,

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:30.995
recommendations, technical specifications, and

00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:34.609
annual reports of NIST cybersecurity activities.

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:38.585
You'll have an opportunity to review these in the exercise.

00:02:38.585 --> 00:02:41.465
There are three industry-specific regulations

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:44.010
you should know as a cybersecurity professional;

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.155
HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:52.850
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.510
or better known as HIPAA,

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.880
security and privacy rules established standards for safe guarding

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:04.975
a patient's medical records and Protected Health Information or PHI.

00:03:04.975 --> 00:03:09.725
The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard, PCI DSS,

00:03:09.725 --> 00:03:13.190
establishes rules for processing, storing,

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.565
transmitting of cardholder data for payment or credit cards.

00:03:18.565 --> 00:03:23.595
The European Union's General Data Privacy Regulation, or GDPR,

00:03:23.595 --> 00:03:26.030
is the EU's law on data protection and

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.760
privacy with potentially extreme consequences if not followed.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.790
Each of these topics could be a lesson in and of themselves.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.105
There are also many other security and privacy regulations.

00:03:38.105 --> 00:03:41.180
This is just a taste of the ones you'll see as

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.000
a cybersecurity professional and as a consumer.
