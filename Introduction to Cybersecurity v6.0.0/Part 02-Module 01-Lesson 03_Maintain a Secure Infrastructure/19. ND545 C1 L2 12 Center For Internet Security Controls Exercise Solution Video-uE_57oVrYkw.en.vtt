00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.305
I'll now explain the answers to this exercise questions.

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:08.700
This question asked about the company's hardware and software inventories.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.190
Having good software and hardware inventory is

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.875
the starting point for any security program.

00:00:13.875 --> 00:00:15.510
If you remember, it's the starting point for

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.005
both the Center for Internet Security and for NIST.

00:00:19.005 --> 00:00:21.705
So for Jilin Roy's scenario,

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:27.405
you'd advise them to write down their software and hardware inventories.

00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:33.230
For example, all major hardware devices and computers such as their network equipment,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.650
like the Linksys routers,

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.040
the types of computers like the Windows Server they have in place,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.990
and then any devices like printers.

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.390
They should also have an inventory of their software in use

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.660
by the company to include any cloud services.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.000
If you remember, they use QuickBooks for

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.355
accounting and Windows for their general applications.

00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:57.020
All of those should be documented as well.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.190
Both the hardware and software inventory should be reviewed at least

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.465
monthly and update it as needed or whenever it changes.

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:09.724
For the second question referred to the CIS 20 controls,

00:01:09.724 --> 00:01:13.335
the top 10 controls should be done first.

00:01:13.335 --> 00:01:15.860
So for your answer to this exercise,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.170
you would choose secure configuration.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.215
Basically, this is how you harden systems, applications, and devices.

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:27.040
We'll talk more about this in a subsequent lesson.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.470
Includes vulnerability management, understanding where

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.040
the weaknesses and flaws and vulnerabilities may lie within their systems.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.730
Malware defenses, that's antivirus and endpoint protection.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.270
Then email and browser protections are to

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.190
protect email as they're coming in against phishing or spam.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.180
Then the browser is how people use the Internet within the company.

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.870
The last two choices that were part of this exercise should

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:57.665
be considered later in an information security program.

00:01:57.665 --> 00:01:59.930
While all security is important,

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.390
some of the items can wait.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.910
The CIS controls help businesses of all sizes mature their security programs by

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.220
taking them through a step-by-step process for securing their infrastructure.
