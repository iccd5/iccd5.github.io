00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.085
In the final section of this lesson,

00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:05.445
we'll look at the CIS cybersecurity best practices.

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:09.825
From their website, cisecurity.org/aboutus,

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:11.760
the Center for Internet Security is

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.985
a non-profit organization that leads a global community of

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:20.700
IT professionals in developing security standards to safeguard against emerging threats.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.315
Their are best practices are made up of two parts.

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.250
The Critical Security Controls,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.660
also known as the CIS,

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.510
CSC or just the CIS controls,

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.650
are the top 20 activities for organizational security.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.665
These are used for small, medium,

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:42.545
and large businesses as they're developing and maintaining a security program.

00:00:42.545 --> 00:00:47.520
The CIS benchmarks are guidelined to secure or lock down operating system,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.155
software, applications, and networks.

00:00:50.155 --> 00:00:51.940
Both are developed by a community of

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.840
cybersecurity professionals from many different areas with the goal of

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.855
establishing a checklist of activities as

00:00:58.855 --> 00:01:02.710
organizations mature their cybersecurity programs.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.460
The CIS controls are made up of 20 actions

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.000
for establishing an organizational security program.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.500
They are an order of priority and work with any security program including,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.925
defense in depth, to reduce risks of security breaches and attacks.

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:24.855
They are separated into three functional areas that the CIS calls implementation groups.

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:27.020
The first are basic controls.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.950
These are controls that should be done by every organization.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.994
Building on that are foundational controls,

00:01:33.994 --> 00:01:38.500
which add additional layers of security for an operation.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.770
Then lastly are the organizational controls,

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.915
that show an organization is more mature with their security best practices.

00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:50.510
Each of these identifies a subset of the controls that

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:54.425
build upon each other as a cyber security program grows.

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:59.585
The CIS basic controls form a foundation for security programs.

00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:03.110
These should be done first as you're building a security program,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.485
includes an inventory and control of hardware assets,

00:02:06.485 --> 00:02:08.660
inventory of software asset,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.550
continuous vulnerability management, controlled use of admin privileges.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.560
Basically, who has root or God-like powers on information systems,

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.680
secure configurations for hardware,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.520
software, any type of devices and lastly, maintaining,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.055
monitoring and analyzing your logs so you can identify when a problem occurs.

00:02:31.055 --> 00:02:35.660
The foundational controls are the next implementation group that

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.685
provide more advanced protection measures based on common types of threats and attacks,

00:02:40.685 --> 00:02:43.175
such as e-mail and web browser protections,

00:02:43.175 --> 00:02:47.585
malware defenses like antivirus or endpoint protection,

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:49.850
controlling your network ports,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.105
protocol services with your boundary across your internal and external networks.

00:02:56.105 --> 00:02:58.640
That includes that secure configuration for

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.970
your network devices like firewalls, routers and switches,

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.840
protecting the data within your infrastructure,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.120
knowing where it is and putting layers around it to protect it as appropriate.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.470
Controlling the access based on need to know,

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:14.780
for remember from earlier,

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.915
this is the least privileged idea.

00:03:16.915 --> 00:03:21.890
Wireless access control, because wireless has increased risk over wired,

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.260
and we just want to make sure that protections are in place.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.600
Then last part of the foundational controls is,

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.355
account monitoring, knowing who has access to what and what they're doing.

00:03:34.355 --> 00:03:40.265
The last group of controls are for establishing an organization-wide security program.

00:03:40.265 --> 00:03:45.200
The first is implementing security training for all users and employees,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.385
this way they know best practices as they're doing their daily work.

00:03:49.385 --> 00:03:52.580
Second, application security that breaks into

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:57.650
the development life cycle as your coders are creating new applications,

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.680
are they building security in?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.160
Incident response and management means planning and preparing for

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.550
an inevitable incident and making sure

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:11.255
you can appropriately respond to any type of incident.

00:04:11.255 --> 00:04:14.420
The fun part, the penetration test and red teams.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.390
This is where you hire a hacker to try to break into

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.865
your systems to see where you're vulnerable and then how to fix those.

00:04:21.865 --> 00:04:27.920
All of these control levels should be implemented to mature a security program.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:30.980
We'll go into more details about the controls in

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.565
subsequent videos where you'll see them in action.

00:04:34.565 --> 00:04:39.835
You should see an overlap between the CIS controls and the NEST CSF,

00:04:39.835 --> 00:04:42.530
they are meant to complement each other.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.710
I will often use both of them working together when

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:49.390
advising companies as they are building a security program.

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.459
Now that you're familiar with the CIS controls,

00:04:52.459 --> 00:04:55.920
you'll use them in a case study exercise.
