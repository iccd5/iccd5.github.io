00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Now, let's talk about the NIST functions and categories.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.100
The NIST CSF functions are

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.540
high level directions on how to apply security throughout a program.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.535
The five functions or steps are,

00:00:11.535 --> 00:00:14.460
identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.710
I'll explain each at a high level so it's

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.040
useful for implementing security best practices.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.425
Step 1 of the framework, identify valuable assets.

00:00:24.425 --> 00:00:26.525
What do you have worth protecting?

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.145
It's like your crown jewels.

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:30.845
Step 2 in the framework is protect.

00:00:30.845 --> 00:00:34.825
What are you going to do to defend those assets from threats?

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:37.365
Step 3 in the framework, detect.

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:40.335
It's knowing when something bad is happening.

00:00:40.335 --> 00:00:42.800
That's known as a cybersecurity event.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.980
Step 4 in the framework is respond.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.095
What do you do when you detect a problem?

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:52.880
You want to make sure you're quick and efficient in your response to a cyber incident.

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.085
Step 5 in the framework is recovery.

00:00:56.085 --> 00:00:59.325
Recovering when something bad happens, it's like an incident.

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:02.585
You want to make sure you can quickly get back to business.

00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:04.910
So for example, with a bank,

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.280
you want to know your most valuable assets,

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.990
like people's money.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:10.625
That's the identify.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:12.470
What protections do you have in place,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.110
whether they are physical or within IT?

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.164
Within IT, it would be like firewalls,

00:01:17.164 --> 00:01:20.665
antivirus, and how to secure operating system.

00:01:20.665 --> 00:01:25.610
Detect. You want to know when someone's trying to gain access to money that's not theirs,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.820
whether it's a bank robber walking into the facility or

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.455
someone trying to gain access through your Internet connection.

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:35.090
Respond, it's like having that security guard.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.640
Take action if a robber enters the building.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.330
Doing the same thing within IT.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.080
Then recovery, that means recovering from the incident.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.735
Getting back to business for your bank as quickly as possible.

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:52.310
The next layer of the CSF core are categories,

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.490
which are a set of cybersecurity activities and outcomes,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.135
organized into 23 different areas.

00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:01.010
So it's what you need to do,

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.320
or prove you do for a cybersecurity program.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.120
For example, the categories under protect include,

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.420
awareness training and your processes for protecting your systems,

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.565
such as how you remotely access work applications and files.

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:25.895
Each category has a unique identifier based on the function and category name.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:33.305
For example, the awareness and training category under protect is identified as PR.AT.

00:02:33.305 --> 00:02:38.560
This structure helps you quickly identify areas within the framework.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.470
In the exercise, you'll provide examples for each of

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.015
the functions to help you understand how they work together.

00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:53.430
Take some time to explore the NIST CSF because it's used throughout industry.
