00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.420
In the maintaining a secure critical infrastructure lesson,

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.200
you evaluated specific security techniques used to

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.549
administer a system that meets industry standards and core controls.

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.250
By now, you should be able to explain

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.635
cybersecurity governance concepts and apply methods to enforce it throughout a company.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.190
Identify common security regulations and frameworks,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.819
and explain how current cybersecurity laws, regulations,

00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:31.990
and standards apply to cybersecurity and data privacy.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.100
Recognize components of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.585
Lastly, recognize the areas of the CIS Controls.

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:43.100
Now that you understand some fundamentals,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.020
you can begin to implement them as you're developing your hacker mindset.
