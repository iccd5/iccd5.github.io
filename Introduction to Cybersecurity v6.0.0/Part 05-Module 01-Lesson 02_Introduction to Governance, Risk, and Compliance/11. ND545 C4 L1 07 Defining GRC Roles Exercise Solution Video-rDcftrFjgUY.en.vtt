00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.530
Ideally, what I'd like to see in this exercise is that governance professionals may write

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.215
a policy restricting use of

00:00:10.215 --> 00:00:15.975
unsecured S3 buckets or write a procedure detailing how to secure them.

00:00:15.975 --> 00:00:19.185
They may also have to assess

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:23.910
existing controls for creating S3 buckets to ensure that they're working properly.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.830
Now, risk management professionals might identify the risk and work with

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.335
stakeholders to develop technical controls to prevent these issues from occurring.

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:38.490
Compliance professionals might have assessed the control as part of

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.450
a compliance obligation or

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.590
identified whether controls for S3 buckets actually exist at all.
