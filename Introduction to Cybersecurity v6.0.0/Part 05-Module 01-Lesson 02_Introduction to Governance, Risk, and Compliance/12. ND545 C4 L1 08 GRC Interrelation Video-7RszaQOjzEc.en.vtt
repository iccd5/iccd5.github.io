00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.915
GRC roles do not operate fully independently.

00:00:03.915 --> 00:00:11.025
Thinking back to how we said GRC and security GRC are a set of interrelated processes,

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:15.000
it's important to understand that each role's activities can

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.095
have a direct effect on other parts of the GRC organization.

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:21.345
Now, what do I mean by that?

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:24.795
Well, what happens if you decide to change a policy?

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:28.050
Assume for a moment that as a governance professional,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.840
you decide to make a change to a policy.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.059
Maybe you decide that all user cell phones must be provided by the organization,

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.260
you can no longer bring your own device.

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:44.000
That makes sense to you because that way the company has more control over what

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.740
communication goes in and out through devices they own just like computers.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.820
Let's think about a few things that can happen as a result of that decision.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.065
What if the organization has never issued a cell phone to any employee?

00:00:57.065 --> 00:01:00.475
Now the company has to buy cell phones for everybody.

00:01:00.475 --> 00:01:05.045
How are we going to make an audit to make sure that that policy is in place?

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:07.400
If we're in the GRC mindset,

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.390
what are you thinking right now?

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.000
I hope we're thinking,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.165
does that policy change align with corporate strategy?

00:01:14.165 --> 00:01:18.440
Did a risk professional identify cell phones as a risk?

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.965
If so, maybe that's what precipitated the change.

00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:25.505
Maybe it was a compliance requirement for some new standard.

00:01:25.505 --> 00:01:30.410
The point here is that each role's actions can have

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:37.720
a ripple effect on the organization as a whole and on all the other GRC roles.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.355
As much as individual roles are focused on specific tasks,

00:01:43.355 --> 00:01:46.730
they must also work together to ensure that

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.450
their work aligns with other professionals in the GRC organization.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.450
As we move through the remaining lessons in this course,

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.850
we'll talk more about how GRC functions affect each other.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:02.090
But for now, here's some common examples of where GRC functions interrelate.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.250
Governance is focused on policies and procedures that effect controls.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.045
Risk management, they ensure controls mitigate risk,

00:02:11.045 --> 00:02:14.180
but also align with compliance obligations.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.260
Compliance, they ensure that their goals align with organizational strategy,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.630
that same strategy set by governance professionals.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.170
The individual functions relate to each other,

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.655
but each role keys off one another.

00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:34.340
I want to spend just a brief moment on GRC software here.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.165
Now, we're not going to be spending a lot of time on GRC software, not in this course.

00:02:40.165 --> 00:02:42.835
But it is a great place to one,

00:02:42.835 --> 00:02:46.320
acknowledge that it exists, and then two,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.730
explain that the use of GRC software can help

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.810
organization stay aligned in its practice of GRC.

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.175
It can provide a number of tangible benefits.

00:02:57.175 --> 00:03:01.190
It can serve as a central repository for GRC information,

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.350
it can improve collaboration,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.770
create efficiency, and reduce cost.

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.390
Now at the same time,

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.690
GRC software can create challenges if

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.070
an organization has a relatively immature GRC practice.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.010
Now, I've seen organizations before where they're

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.310
spending a lot of money on GRC software,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.485
but it wasn't being used at all.

00:03:24.485 --> 00:03:28.010
The big reason for that is that the governance, risk,

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:34.400
and compliance teams all had separate ideas as to how GRC should be managed.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.120
If your company doesn't already have GRC software,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.850
I'd likely tell you to get a process in place first and then turn to software after.
