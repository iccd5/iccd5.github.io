00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.670
Great job getting through this lesson.

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:06.255
This is just the beginning of our security GRC journey.

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:09.315
Let's do a quick recap of what we went over.

00:00:09.315 --> 00:00:13.800
We distinguished security GRC from an overall GRC context.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.035
We defined GRC roles.

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:20.520
We talked about ways that each area of GRC interrelate.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:26.115
Then finally, we discussed how to interpret organizational GRC needs.

00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:29.120
As we continue to move through this course,

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:35.210
I want you to continue to think about security GRC as a collection of security outcomes.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.950
But also remember to think about each component as an individual role.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.200
Each one of those designed to support

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.735
the organization's mission by accomplishing their specific tasks.

00:00:46.735 --> 00:00:52.625
Now, I know that GRC doesn't have the pizzazz or swagger of other security roles.

00:00:52.625 --> 00:00:57.590
But it's vitally important to a business's success and something that you

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.735
have to master if you have aspirations of becoming a chief information security officer.

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:04.370
Stick with it.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.750
We'll see you in the next lesson.
