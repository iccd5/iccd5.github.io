00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.775
At security, GRC is very highest level.

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:04.980
The three parts operate like this.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.885
Governance is responsible for ensuring security controls are operating effectively.

00:00:09.885 --> 00:00:13.035
Risk is responsible for measuring risk.

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.220
Compliance is responsible for making sure that

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.265
security meets compliance obligations or what we might call control objectives.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:26.640
To this point, we've talked about GRC

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.525
as a collection of high level outcomes or functions.

00:00:30.525 --> 00:00:37.035
But the practice of GRC isn't one individual process with these three components,

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:39.775
it's really three separate roles.

00:00:39.775 --> 00:00:44.560
Each individual role is responsible for the outcomes that you see here.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.435
Again, governance, ensuring controls operate effectively,

00:00:48.435 --> 00:00:50.840
risk measuring risk, and compliance,

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.075
ensuring compliance obligations are met.

00:00:53.075 --> 00:00:57.440
Keeping in mind that we're going to talk about each GRC function as a role,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.320
let's highlight just a few day-to-day responsibilities

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.830
that a governance professional might encounter.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.670
Governance professionals in many ways act as a bridge between security and business.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.970
One of the ways that they do that is by managing many of the policies

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.290
and procedures that establish the dos and don'ts of security in a accompany.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.560
These are things like the information security policy or

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.405
even the acceptable use policies that literally dictate how security operates,

00:01:26.405 --> 00:01:30.545
and how end users should treat information and technology assets.

00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:34.855
They also help in aligning security strategy with business strategy,

00:01:34.855 --> 00:01:36.680
and as I've mentioned before,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.085
they spend a great deal of time designing tests

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:44.330
to measure whether or not security controls are operating as intended.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.730
The risk professional, they're are laser focused on risk.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.849
They're responsible for identifying security risks or threats,

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:56.255
measuring the organization's exposure to the threats,

00:01:56.255 --> 00:01:58.975
and then reporting risk to management.

00:01:58.975 --> 00:02:04.040
Then finally, they have to work together with stakeholders to identify

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.025
ways of mitigating unacceptable risk and ensuring that those activities are completed.

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:11.135
Now, finally, you have compliance.

00:02:11.135 --> 00:02:15.395
The main role of the compliance professional is to identify

00:02:15.395 --> 00:02:19.565
organization's security compliance obligations and then

00:02:19.565 --> 00:02:24.235
assess the organization's level of compliance against those obligations.

00:02:24.235 --> 00:02:27.350
In other words, understand what you must

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.955
do and then measure whether or not you're actually doing it.

00:02:31.955 --> 00:02:37.040
They also assist operational security in becoming more efficient by designing

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.655
controls that might meet one or more of the organization's security obligations.

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:46.870
We'll talk much more about all of those obligations in another lesson.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.800
Finally, in this lesson,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.025
I want to spend just a moment on operational security.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:54.790
We've said that term a number of times.

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.470
When I say operational security,

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.350
I mean the folks that are actually installing,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.215
operating, and monitoring security controls.

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:05.755
We haven't talked much about their role,

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:09.875
but now that you have a high level overview of each GRC role,

00:03:09.875 --> 00:03:13.570
it's important to talk about what GRC isn't.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.940
GRC roles normally have no involvement in

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.130
day-to-day control activities other than writing policies and procedures,

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:23.449
which if you remember,

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:25.970
I'm calling those preventive controls.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.240
Everything else though, configuring firewalls,

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.010
configuring other equipment, all of that is off limits.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.675
The reason for that is that GRC roles serve to provide a level of oversight.

00:03:38.675 --> 00:03:41.885
Following the principle of segregation of duties,

00:03:41.885 --> 00:03:46.420
an individual can't be responsible for assessing their own work.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.095
You want to have independent monitors.

00:03:49.095 --> 00:03:54.660
That's the role that GRC plays as it relates to operational security.
