00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
In this scenario, you're helping Jilin and Royce set

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.085
their identification and authentication rules under Windows 10 PC.

00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:12.270
Once you log into the virtual Windows 10 system assigned to you,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:17.415
you can set the password policy on the computer by using the local security policy.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.010
To do this, go to the Windows start bar,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.450
click inside of it,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.720
and you just begin typing what you want to do.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.730
In this case setting a local security policy.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.070
What's nice, it automatically pops up as the app you want and you click on it.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.925
A window then appears with the local security policy.

00:00:34.925 --> 00:00:39.844
This is all of the different configuration settings for security on Windows.

00:00:39.844 --> 00:00:45.935
This works for both local systems as well as group systems across a whole domain.

00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:51.050
Note though you need Windows 10 professional or enterprise in order for this to work,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.810
doesn't work with Windows Home.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.035
Within the local security policy look at the different security settings.

00:00:57.035 --> 00:01:00.890
For this exercise, we're looking at the account policies to see then,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.130
you click on the little carat next to it.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.270
In particular we want to address

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:10.540
the password policies and then also the account lockout policies.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.450
First the password policies, for example,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.610
let's say we want to set the maximum password age.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.685
This is the number of days before someone needs to change their password.

00:01:22.685 --> 00:01:25.570
The default in Windows is 42.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.635
Let's just say we want it to be 90 days for Joel and Royce.

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:35.180
So you click 90, you can click "Apply" or "Okay",

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.615
and it'll automatically set it.

00:01:37.615 --> 00:01:41.645
You can also set the minimum password length similarly.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:44.210
Say we want it to be 10 characters.

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.265
Now for any of these settings,

00:01:46.265 --> 00:01:47.390
if you have a question,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.610
you can click on the "Explain" tab.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.900
This will show you a description of this particular setting.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.315
Really comes in handy when you need help about how a setting works.

00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:03.600
We'll keep this at 10 characters and there you go.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.650
You can see we are changing the password policy.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.249
Similarly with the account lockout policy,

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:14.075
where we can change the number of invalid login attempts.

00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:19.545
Let's just say five mis typed passwords and they will be locked out.

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:23.110
In Windows it'll automatically set a lockout duration,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.760
and how soon to reset the 30 minutes, really easy.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.105
This is how you use the local security policy,

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:37.740
account policies to change security settings within a Windows 10 system.
