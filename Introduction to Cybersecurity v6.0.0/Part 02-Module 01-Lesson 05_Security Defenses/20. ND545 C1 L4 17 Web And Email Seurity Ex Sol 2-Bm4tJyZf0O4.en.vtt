00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
I'll now show you how to review your cookies and history in Chrome.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:11.205
To do this, click on the three dots top-right corner and select "Settings".

00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:16.290
Within the Settings, select "Privacy and Security".

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.040
You can now go into the different Site Settings,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.365
click on the cookies and site data.

00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:26.500
You now see the different options you have with cookies.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.390
But we want to view cookies that have been collected by a website.

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.170
So if we click on the "See all cookies and site data",

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.520
this is all of the remnants that has been left for my Web browsing.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.340
Now let's look at what Udacity collects.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.735
If we scroll down within the site data,

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:49.190
you'll see there are 21 cookies from when I went to Udacity.com.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.235
If you click on the little arrow next to it,

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:54.560
you can see all of the little cookies.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.825
This is the data that Udacity collects when you just go to their basic website,

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.780
to include the country you may live in,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.645
your client ID and when you were there.

00:01:06.645 --> 00:01:13.040
You can clear your Chrome settings by following the steps in the previous video.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.910
You can also learn about the history of how and when

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.385
someone went to the Internet through their browser history.

00:01:21.385 --> 00:01:25.840
How often do you clear your browser history, cache, and cookies?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.590
Many of us don't think to do it and when we do it breaks what we do on the Internet.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.590
So just be aware of the tracks you leave when browsing.
