00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
In this video, I'll explain how you keep

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.675
your computers and applications up-to-date with patches.

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:12.165
This is often one of the easiest and most cost-effective ways to secure systems.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:17.325
Patches fix vulnerabilities before evil hackers have a chance to exploit them.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:19.410
By the end, you'll be able to describe

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.260
the process and techniques for applying computer patches into

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.840
updates and determine patch levels for common systems and applications.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.010
To explain patching I'll use our car analogy.

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.860
You can't get a brand new car every time something gets old or needs to be fixed.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.440
What do you do to keep your cars as new as possible?

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.990
Well, we're told to perform routine maintenance like changing the oil,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:48.340
putting air and tires,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.520
and taking it in for service if there's a manufacturer's recall.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.100
Simple maintenance can keep our cars updated.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.135
If our tire gets a hole, what are options?

00:01:00.135 --> 00:01:06.840
Well, we can put a patch on it or we can buy new tires or even a new car.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.185
But what's most cost effective?

00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:15.705
A patch. It's the same idea for our computers.

00:01:15.705 --> 00:01:19.750
Whenever there's a problem like the vulnerabilities you learned earlier,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.495
we usually don't buy a new computer or get a new application.

00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:28.175
We fix it by installing a patch or update from the manufacturer.

00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:31.280
Side note, the best practice is to always get

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.555
software updates from a trusted source like the manufacturer.

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:41.800
Beware of third-party sites distributing fixes as they may have malicious code embedded.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.480
In cybersecurity, a patch,

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.345
meaning a software code revision,

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:50.705
is used to fix some type of an issue,

00:01:50.705 --> 00:01:52.670
whether it's with functionality,

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.180
security, or to add new features.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.665
You probably noticed that software patches,

00:01:57.665 --> 00:02:00.365
updates, and upgrades happen all the time,

00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:02.360
and that it can be overwhelming,

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.000
especially for a large enterprise with lots of computers and applications.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.170
That's why organizations need a patch management process.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.500
From NIST, the patch management process are

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.710
the steps you take for getting patches on computers.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.875
There are five steps.

00:02:20.875 --> 00:02:24.685
First, notification, which is the vendor announcement.

00:02:24.685 --> 00:02:27.050
They tell you, "Hey, we have a patch ready,

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.365
you can download it and install it."

00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:32.310
Second is that identification.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.255
Remember your earlier asset inventory?

00:02:35.255 --> 00:02:39.820
You need to identify if the patch even make sense for your environment.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.855
Third step is deployment,

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:43.895
downloading it to the computers,

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:46.190
getting it ready for the next step,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.900
which is installation, which puts it or installs it on the computer.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.295
Last, and you don't want to forget this,

00:02:54.295 --> 00:02:58.350
is verification, confirming it's there.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:03.805
Often, this step is skipped and you don't realize you're behind in patches.

00:03:03.805 --> 00:03:06.050
By following this process,

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.970
we can ensure our computers and software stay up-to-date and therefore more secure.
