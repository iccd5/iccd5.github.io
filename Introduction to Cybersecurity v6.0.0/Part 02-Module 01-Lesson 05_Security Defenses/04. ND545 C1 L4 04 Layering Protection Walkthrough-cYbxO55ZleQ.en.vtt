00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
A part of layering security is hardening systems.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.120
This means applying optimal security settings to

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.030
your systems and applications to protect against attacks,

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.565
misuse, or even human error.

00:00:11.565 --> 00:00:15.360
Rather than creating your own technical security standards,

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.745
it's better to follow what others are doing.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.970
Fortunately, we have a resource for that.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.400
The Center for Internet Security,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.625
provides benchmark guides for common networking devices,

00:00:26.625 --> 00:00:29.310
operating systems, and applications.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.355
The CIS guides, provide a target for optimal security on specific technologies,

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:39.999
and can be used to compare an organization systems against those targets.

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:46.485
The Center for Internet Security benchmarks website, cisecurity.org, CIS benchmarks,

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:49.910
provides over 140 technical guidelines

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.680
providing best practices for securing the systems configuration.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.950
CIS benchmarks are distributed free of charge in PDF format.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.860
There are so many examples of their benchmarks

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.860
when you scroll down on their website that you can see.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.450
Let me show you some of

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.620
the Microsoft benchmarks provided by the Center for Internet Security.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.740
If you need to secure your Internet Information Server,

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.324
that's Microsoft IIS or Microsoft Office,

00:01:16.324 --> 00:01:20.270
or if you're using Windows desktop or server,

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.815
they have guides for how to secure it.

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:28.430
Let's look at the CIS securing Microsoft Windows desktop benchmark.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.400
You'll need to sign up on their website,

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.020
to see this specific guide.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.640
When you do, you'll get an email with a link to this PDF.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.525
The table of contents for the CIS benchmark for Windows desktop,

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:44.185
gives you an idea of what it contains.

00:01:44.185 --> 00:01:49.670
Basically, it's a long list of recommended configuration settings.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.200
As an example, let's look at just some of the account policies.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:59.945
The table of contents gives you an idea of what this CIS benchmark contains.

00:01:59.945 --> 00:02:02.150
It's basically a long list of

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.205
recommended configuration settings for your Windows desktop.

00:02:06.205 --> 00:02:09.015
Let's look at some account policies.

00:02:09.015 --> 00:02:11.520
When you're setting a password policy,

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.370
this will tell you the different settings.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.750
For example, history should remember 24 passwords.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.120
How many days you should take before you reset a password?

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.055
Is 60 according to Center for Internet Security.

00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:27.735
Minimum password, length 14 characters.

00:02:27.735 --> 00:02:30.365
These are the optimal settings.

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:32.240
If you go through this document,

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.020
you'll see that there are over 1300 pages of

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.455
these different configuration settings to really lock down a Microsoft desktop.

00:02:41.455 --> 00:02:43.165
Use this as an example,

00:02:43.165 --> 00:02:46.430
as you're securing your Windows desktop systems.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.310
This is just a quick taste of the benchmarks

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.730
available through the Center for Internet Security.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.260
You should take time to explore their website,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.240
and their tremendous resources.
