00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
On the virtual Windows 10 system assigned to you,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.575
you can create local user accounts by following these steps.

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:11.655
It starts by using the control panel.

00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:14.295
Again, in the start bar,

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:17.490
pull up the control panel by typing it,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.785
and you can go into the control panel app.

00:00:21.785 --> 00:00:23.415
From the control panel app,

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:25.230
you see numerous options for

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.010
security and administration settings on the Windows 10 system.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.909
For this exercise, we are looking at user accounts.

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:34.785
So select that one.

00:00:34.785 --> 00:00:39.810
From user accounts, you click in "User Accounts" again,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:43.180
and then "Manage Another Account".

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.470
To add a new user,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.014
you click on the "Add New User in PC Settings" link.

00:00:50.014 --> 00:00:52.580
A pop-up window will then appear,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.160
which allows you the opportunity to see

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.210
the current users and then add someone else to this PC.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.580
Another way of getting into the screen,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.485
for those who are more technically adept,

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:07.625
this is what's known as the local user manager pop-up.

00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:11.615
So you can actually go to this directly from the start bar as well.

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:13.999
But from here you click on "Users",

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.670
and when you right-click in the area,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.765
in the middle click on "New User".

00:01:19.765 --> 00:01:22.400
Here I can type a new users name.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.910
So test user, whatever full name you want.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:27.440
If you want a description,

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.395
include a password, always a good idea.

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:34.519
Of course, I'm not using the word password123 for their password,

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:36.650
and then you re-enter it.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.400
It's recommended you keep the default setting of user must

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.740
change password at next login, click "Create".

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.465
Once you create the new user,

00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:49.645
you will see it applied here.

00:01:49.645 --> 00:01:53.765
On this computer, you want to make sure all of the accounts are valid,

00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:56.060
and that they are not administrators.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.935
So how do you know if a particular account is an administrator or not?

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:09.005
Well, you can find that out by clicking on them and going into properties and member of.

00:02:09.005 --> 00:02:12.215
If you see the group administrators,

00:02:12.215 --> 00:02:14.420
then this person would be a member of

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.710
an administrator group which has full power on this PC.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.850
So Jill, in this case is not an administrator.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.495
From the local users and groups panel,

00:02:26.495 --> 00:02:29.210
you can add users, remove users,

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:32.045
disable them, and change their groups.

00:02:32.045 --> 00:02:35.150
It's another powerful Windows setting that you can

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.120
use as you're securing operating systems.
