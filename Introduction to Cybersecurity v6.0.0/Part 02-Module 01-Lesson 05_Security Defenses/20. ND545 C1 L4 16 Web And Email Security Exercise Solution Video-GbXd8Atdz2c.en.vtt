00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
In this exercise, you got to use the 'have I been pwned?'

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.325
website. Let me show you what happens when I enter my e-mail.

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:11.460
I enter it in the block and click on

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.405
the question mark whether I've been pwned or owned or not.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:20.745
When I do, you'll see that my e-mail has been pwned.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.070
Yes. I use Mr. Bill on purpose.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.630
It's been compromised with two different breaches.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.815
You can scroll down and see some ideas and how to protect your email.

00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:34.915
Let's see where my email has been breached.

00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:39.395
Well, first of all, the adapt breach of November 2018,

00:00:39.395 --> 00:00:41.900
which compromised my email address,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.670
my job title, name,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.580
phone number, work address,

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.715
all information I'm actually fine about that's all public information about me.

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:56.345
It's similar with the Apollo breach from July of 2018.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:01:00.490
Same type of information, public information.

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:07.025
So just because you see an email address has been pwned is not necessarily a bad thing.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:09.040
What did you find about your email?

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.600
Have you been pwned too?
