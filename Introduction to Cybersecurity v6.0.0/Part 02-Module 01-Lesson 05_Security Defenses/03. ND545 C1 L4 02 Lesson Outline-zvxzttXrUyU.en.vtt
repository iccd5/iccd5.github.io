00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
Throughout this lesson, you'll understand methods for

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.615
establishing and maintaining the security of a network,

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:09.615
computing environment, and applications.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.505
There are four sections.

00:00:11.505 --> 00:00:15.780
First, layering protection, which is that defense in depth.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.555
Second, identity and access control.

00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.525
Knowing who can access what assets.

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:25.230
Patching and updating, taking care of vulnerabilities,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.345
making sure they can't be exploited.

00:00:27.345 --> 00:00:30.810
Last, web and e-mail security since this

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.335
is the most prominent way hackers get into systems.

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:39.965
The lesson's learning objectives are to explain how security defenses are layered through

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:42.020
different security architectures and

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.690
explaining components for identity and access control.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.350
Who can gain access to information systems.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.480
Determining patched levels for common systems to take care of vulnerabilities.

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.959
Describe the process and technique for plying

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:03.420
protection techniques like for e-mail and other ways of communicating over the Internet.
