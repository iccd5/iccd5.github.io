00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
To set file and folder permissions in Windows, follow these steps.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.280
First of all, just create a folder on the desktop,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.400
right-click and then select "New",

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.590
and then "Folder", easy as that.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.215
You can rename it to be whatever you want.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:18.030
With the new folder created,

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.800
right-click on it, select "Give access to".

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.355
This point I'm just going to give access to Jill.

00:00:26.355 --> 00:00:29.775
In the Network Access window that pops up,

00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:33.000
select, "Yes, share the items".

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.945
This now shares the folder with Jill.

00:00:36.945 --> 00:00:40.550
To ensure that users have full access to the folder as opposed to

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.360
just read-only access, right-click again,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.230
I encourage you practice right-clicking on things instead of left clicking,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.455
right-click highlight properties and click on it.

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:57.975
Click on the "Sharing" tab and then select "Share".

00:00:57.975 --> 00:01:01.575
From this window you can choose people to share with.

00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:04.800
As you can see, Jill right now just has read access,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.010
and we want her to have read and write,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.185
meaning she can change this file.

00:01:09.185 --> 00:01:13.265
Click the "Share" button when you're done, click "Done".

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:17.480
Now this whatever folder is shared with Jill.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.645
You can take the opposite approach to remove file-sharing as well from users,

00:01:23.645 --> 00:01:27.240
which you may need to do in a future exercise.
