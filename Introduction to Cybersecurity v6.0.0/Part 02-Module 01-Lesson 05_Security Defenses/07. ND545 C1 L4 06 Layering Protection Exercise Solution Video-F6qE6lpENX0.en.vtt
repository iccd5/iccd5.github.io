00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Now let me explain the answers to the exercise.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.825
Using the Jill and Roy's Accounting as a case study,

00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:08.325
for a typical company,

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:11.894
you said that there are many layers in place,

00:00:11.894 --> 00:00:14.265
starting with that network layer,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:16.110
they have a Linksys switch.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.900
Question is, has that been hardened?

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.945
Is it locked down to prevent who can access it and what they can do?

00:00:22.945 --> 00:00:26.165
The next layer is the mobile technologies.

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:28.250
For example, they use iPhones,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.970
but they also have a bring your own device or BYOD policy.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.210
So you don't know what other type of mobile devices could

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.170
potentially be used for Jill and Roy's accounting services.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.975
The next layer is the operating system,

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.850
in this case Windows 10,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.830
which should be locked down to provide

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:50.680
optimum defenses against known vulnerabilities and threats.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.805
The fourth layer is the application layer,

00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:58.985
and Jill and Roy's uses the application of QuickBooks for their accounting systems.

00:00:58.985 --> 00:01:04.930
This includes very sensitive tax and accounting data that needs to be protected.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.295
The last layer is that data layer.

00:01:08.295 --> 00:01:10.130
They're using very sensitive data,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.490
so it should be encrypted within a database,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.120
within any files, and even across the network.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.970
Each of these are different layers of

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.320
protection that needs to be used not just for the Jill and Roy's case study,

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.065
but for all organizations.

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:30.120
The Center for Internet Security benchmarks that apply to

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.245
Jill and Roy's are Microsoft Office,

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:36.985
because that's what they're running for their email on Word and Excel.

00:01:36.985 --> 00:01:39.199
The Microsoft Windows Desktop,

00:01:39.199 --> 00:01:41.060
because they use Windows 10.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.845
From the case study,

00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:44.210
they have a print server,

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.240
that means they print things to some type of a device.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.995
That should be locked down.

00:01:48.995 --> 00:01:53.195
The last CIS benchmark would be for Google Chrome,

00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:58.160
because it's mentioned in the case study that they use Chrome for web browsing.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.650
The Debian Linux operating system and

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.955
Apache Tomcat web server application are not mentioned in the case study,

00:02:04.955 --> 00:02:07.375
so you can ignore those benchmarks.

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:11.000
If you were a security consultant helping Jill and Roy's,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.700
you can use these benchmarks as guides to secure or harden their infrastructure.
