00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.865
For this exercise, you are using the Microsoft Security Resource Center, MSRC.

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:08.535
This is a one-stop shop for all information

00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:11.805
about Microsoft patches, updates, and vulnerability.

00:00:11.805 --> 00:00:16.860
You can go to their website and read their Security Guide FAQ.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.420
From the MSRC, Security Update Guide FAQ,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.460
you'll learn that Microsoft schedules the release of security patches on Patch Tuesday,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.450
the second Tuesday of every month at about 10:00 AM Pacific time.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.780
Microsoft also sends out a notification whenever there's

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.335
a material information that affects its customers security.

00:00:37.335 --> 00:00:39.600
You can see the other types of questions,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.010
you can get answered through the Microsoft Update Guide FAQ.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.235
Let's go back to their main page.

00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:49.520
Going back to their main page,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.715
you see their security update guide,

00:00:52.715 --> 00:00:58.714
which contains all of the information about recent notifications and patches.

00:00:58.714 --> 00:01:02.450
For example, you see the May 2020 Security Updates.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.700
You can read all what they patched.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.894
Same thing with the April patch updates.

00:01:07.894 --> 00:01:13.040
You see the list of all of the different updates and the articles associated with

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.840
each and even the CVE details that you learned about earlier.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.925
You can equate this patch with subsequent risk based on the CVE score.

00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:25.480
So let's take a look at one of these.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.630
When you click on it,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.600

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.750
You can understand the severity of the patch and

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.825
then the highlights of what this patch will fix.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:44.000
For example, with this one, updating,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.384
verifying the user names and passwords,

00:01:46.384 --> 00:01:51.305
improving security when you're using Windows performs basic operations.

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:55.445
In other words, this is a patch that needs to be applied.

00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:59.495
