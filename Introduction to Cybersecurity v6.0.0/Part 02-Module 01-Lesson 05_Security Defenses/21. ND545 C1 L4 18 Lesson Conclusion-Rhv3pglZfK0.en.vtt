00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.045
In this lesson, you learned about establishing security defenses on computer systems.

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:10.875
It's what you need to do to prevent an unauthorized access on your systems and networks.

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:16.200
It's done by layering the defenses which is that defense in depth.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.360
Having identity access control in place with user IDs,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.825
passwords, or even better yet, multi factor authentication.

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:29.655
Minimizing vulnerabilities by keeping your devices and applications

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:34.590
updated and using email and the web safely.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.520
By now, you should be able to explain ways to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.880
create and manage the security of a network,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.880
computing environment, and applications.
