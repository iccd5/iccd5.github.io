00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
With so many vulnerabilities in all of our systems,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.850
it's nice that there are plenty of resources to help us identify and analyze them.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.130
For this exercise, you explore two of them.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.510
The primary resources you'll use are the MITER Common Vulnerabilities and

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.060
Exposure or CVE list found at cve.mitre.org,

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.260
and the NIST National Vulnerability Database or NVD found at nvd.nist.gov.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.615
Let me show you what they look like.

00:00:30.615 --> 00:00:37.295
CVE is a list of common identifiers for publicly known cybersecurity vulnerabilities.

00:00:37.295 --> 00:00:41.045
It was started over 20 years ago to create a common language,

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:43.855
a naming convention for all vulnerabilities.

00:00:43.855 --> 00:00:47.000
In the early days, manufacturers would have their own names and

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.510
identification numbers which became very confusing.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.915
Now CVE is the industry standard for vulnerability and exposure identifiers.

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:59.000
The process of creating a CVE entry begins

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.105
with the discovery of a potential security vulnerability.

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:07.445
That information is then assigned a CVE ID by the numbering authority,

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:10.415
who then writes the description and adds references.

00:01:10.415 --> 00:01:16.999
Then a completed entry is added to the CVE list and posted on the CVE website.

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:20.375
The National Vulnerability Database or NVD,

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:25.460
is the US government's repository of standards-based vulnerability management data.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.755
They perform analysis on the CVEs that have been published to the CVE dictionary.

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:35.030
They do this by aggregating data points from the description references

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.075
applied in any supplemental data that can be found publicly at the time.

00:01:40.075 --> 00:01:45.240
You'll get to work with these two websites as a part of the exercise.
