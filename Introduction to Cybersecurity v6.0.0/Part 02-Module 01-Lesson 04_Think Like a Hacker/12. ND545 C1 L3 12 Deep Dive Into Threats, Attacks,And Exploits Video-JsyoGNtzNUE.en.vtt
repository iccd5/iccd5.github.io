00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.205
Now that you know about vulnerabilities,

00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:05.545
you need to learn about threats that can take advantage of them.

00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:09.840
In this session, you'll review ways that vulnerabilities may be exploited by

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.805
a threat source that can damage your organization's information,

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:19.230
technology, systems, networks, or even people.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.490
Nist defines a threat as any circumstance or event with

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.720
the potential to adversely impact organizational operations,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.415
including their mission, functions,

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:32.610
their image even, or reputation also can

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.615
impact organizational assets, individuals, other organizations,

00:00:36.615 --> 00:00:41.830
or the nation through an information system via unauthorized access,

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.575
destruction, disclosure, modification of information,

00:00:45.575 --> 00:00:48.010
or denial of service.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.685
But what does this really mean?

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:54.440
Let's use some examples to explain threats.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.645
We're using the car analogy.

00:00:56.645 --> 00:01:01.870
Let's consider threats that can cause damage to you as the driver or your vehicle,

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.600
in other words, assets.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.030
One could be seeing nails on the road,

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.840
causing a flat tire or rain can cause you to slip on the road,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.800
maybe crash into another driver or something along the side,

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.750
and then there's always the threat of a drunk driver.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.945
Now let's look at threats to information technology.

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:26.870
A potential threat is a malicious hacker, You know,

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.850
the one trying to breach your data,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.535
gain access to your information technology.

00:01:31.535 --> 00:01:33.665
As we learned earlier,

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:36.380
it could also be a disgruntled employee,

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.935
that insider threat, who may not be really trying to help your organization.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:46.580
The last type of threat we shouldn't forget is user error.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.790
Mistakes are as big of a problem as any malicious hacker or insider threat may ever be.

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.375
So don't ever discount user error.

00:01:55.375 --> 00:01:59.210
There are two terms related to threats you need to know about.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.415
The first is threat source.

00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:05.975
This is the person or thing that is likely to cause damage.

00:02:05.975 --> 00:02:10.460
For example, drunk drivers are a threat source, went on the road.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.210
Someone using a user ID and a password doesn't belong to them.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.790
As an example, on the cyber realm,

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.840
a threat vector is the method or path

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.120
a threat source will take to exploit a vulnerability or cause damage.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.515
The Internet is a common threat vector.

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:32.105
Physical access can be another.

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:35.120
In cybersecurity, a threat may try to

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.660
exploit or take advantage of a vulnerability in a computer system,

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.255
this is basically the attack.

00:02:41.255 --> 00:02:46.585
Hackers attack our information systems by exploiting vulnerabilities.

00:02:46.585 --> 00:02:49.010
And example of a typical attack is

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.560
a malicious hacker who may try to crack a password database.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.835
The malicious hacker is the threat,

00:02:55.835 --> 00:02:59.180
and cracking the password is the exploit which

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.630
takes advantage of software vulnerabilities that give access

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.870
to the password database and then they use

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.595
the results to gain unauthorized access into computer systems.

00:03:09.595 --> 00:03:13.925
Here the hacker is exploiting multiple vulnerabilities.

00:03:13.925 --> 00:03:18.245
First, gaining access to the password database, second,

00:03:18.245 --> 00:03:21.740
having the ability to crack it and third,

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.400
exploiting the results and using that password.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.580
Remember the hacking lifecycle from earlier?

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.190
This is the break it phase.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.640
By the way, malicious hackers, the threat,

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.600
follow the same process with just a few modifications.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.835
They start with their target,

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:42.590
they learn about it,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.160
they perform their recon and explore it and try to break it,

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.130
meaning exploiting the vulnerabilities and then will

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.255
exploit that vulnerability to do damage.

00:03:53.255 --> 00:03:56.540
Next, you'll review the website that contains

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.630
information on many attack and threat vectors.
