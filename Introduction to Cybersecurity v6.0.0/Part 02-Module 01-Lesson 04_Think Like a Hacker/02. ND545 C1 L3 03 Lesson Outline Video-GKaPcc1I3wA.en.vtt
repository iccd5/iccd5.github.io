00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
In this lesson, you'll cover the following topics.

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.330
The hacking lifecycle, which is the process

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.930
both hackers and cybersecurity professionals follow.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.690
Vulnerability management goes into how to identify and fix software security bugs.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.235
Lastly, a deep dive into threats, attacks, and exploits,

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:25.685
which explains how those vulnerabilities can be used to hurt organizations.

00:00:25.685 --> 00:00:27.470
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.960
you will be able to categorize assets,

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.915
risks, threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits,

00:00:32.915 --> 00:00:36.745
identify different types of vulnerabilities in a system,

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:40.450
identify the categories of a cyber threat,

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.420
determine the phase of a cyber attack,

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.210
and recognize common exploits.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.390
These are the abilities shown by hackers.
