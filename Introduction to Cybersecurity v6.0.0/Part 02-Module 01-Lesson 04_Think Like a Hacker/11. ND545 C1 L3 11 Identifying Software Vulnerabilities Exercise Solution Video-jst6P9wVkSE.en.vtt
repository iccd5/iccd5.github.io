00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
For this exercise, you explore the CVE and NVD websites.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.240
To find out vulnerabilities about common technologies,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.550
really is you start with the website and click on "Search the CVE List".

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.320
In the search bar,

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.770
you can put in whatever application you want.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:23.095
For example, let's look at Google Chrome, click "Submit".

00:00:23.095 --> 00:00:26.360
This then brings up a very long list

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.425
of all of the known vulnerabilities associated with Chrome.

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:32.945
Let me show you what one looks like.

00:00:32.945 --> 00:00:37.235
If we go into CVE 2020-6484,

00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:42.950
we can learn what's the description and how it could potentially be exploited.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:48.545
The type of threat like this as a remote attacker can bypass navigation restrictions.

00:00:48.545 --> 00:00:50.855
To learn more about the vulnerability,

00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:55.295
you can then go to the National Vulnerability Database entry about it,

00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:59.105
which provides more details on this specific vulnerability,

00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:02.215
and which versions of Chrome will correct it.

00:01:02.215 --> 00:01:05.225
What I really appreciate about the NVD site,

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:08.075
you see the base score here,

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:11.760
giving it a 6.5 out of 10 scale.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.375
This will tell you how quickly you should potentially patch this type of a vulnerability.

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:25.155
Take some time exploring both the NVD and the CVE websites,

00:01:25.155 --> 00:01:30.150
to learn more about the vulnerability management process.
