00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.154
Where do you find information about exploits, threats, and attacks?

00:00:04.154 --> 00:00:07.125
There are hacking books that provide some detail,

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:10.605
but these tend to get out of date rather quickly.

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:17.545
A better resource is the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework found at attack.mitre.org.

00:00:17.545 --> 00:00:19.850
It is a globally accessible knowledge base of

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.930
cybersecurity attack scenarios based on real-world observations.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.839
This knowledge base is used as the foundation

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:29.750
for the development of specific threat methodologies.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.100
In the private sector,

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.315
US government, and in the cybersecurity product and service community.

00:00:35.315 --> 00:00:38.735
I'll explain some of the columns in the website matrix.

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:40.130
When you go to the website,

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.660
if you scroll down,

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.470
you will see their attack matrix for enterprise.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.380
You see it's separated by columns.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.340
For example, initial axis is how do

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.655
the hackers initially gain access into a cyber system?

00:00:52.655 --> 00:00:56.270
Execution is how did they execute their attack.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.690
Persistence, how did they make sure they can stay there and not be noticed?

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.220
Privilege escalation is moving from general user to administrative user.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.155
Defensive evasion is trying to hide their tracks.

00:01:09.155 --> 00:01:13.925
Credential access is trying to find a valid user ID and a password.

00:01:13.925 --> 00:01:18.140
Discovery is how they perform their own recognizance.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.115
Lateral movement is how do they move across a network?

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:28.429
You can use this matrix to better understand all of these different types of threats.

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:30.395
In this sections exercise,

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:34.280
you will explore threat information found on the mitre attack website.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.245
Like I do in my example,

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:42.120
I encourage you to take the time to explore the vast information available here.
