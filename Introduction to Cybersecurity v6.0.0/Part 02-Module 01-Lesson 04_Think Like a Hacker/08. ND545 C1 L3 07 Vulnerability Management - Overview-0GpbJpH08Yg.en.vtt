00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
In IT, vulnerabilities are inevitable.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.990
No matter how hard we try,

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.504
there will always be weaknesses or flaws in software,

00:00:08.504 --> 00:00:10.950
operating systems, and networks.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.170
But it's not always a bad thing.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.960
Most vulnerabilities are minor or the path to exploit them is long and difficult.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.745
You need to pay attention to know what vulnerabilities need to be fixed right away,

00:00:23.745 --> 00:00:25.845
and which ones can maybe wait.

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:28.320
Before you dive into vulnerability management,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.470
let's review the definition of a vulnerability.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:37.725
If you recall, NIST defines a vulnerability as a weakness in an information system,

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:40.380
system security procedures, internal controls,

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.640
or implementation, that could be exploited or triggered by a threat.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.675
But what does this really mean?

00:00:48.675 --> 00:00:52.940
You need to ask questions as part of the vulnerability management process,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.365
to understand what actions you should take.

00:00:56.365 --> 00:01:02.845
These questions include: where do you find vulnerabilities in IT and in the world?

00:01:02.845 --> 00:01:05.510
What do they look like?

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.760
How do you know if there are problem?

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.280
What should you do about them?

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.440
To answer these questions,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.350
you follow the vulnerability management process,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.615
which is actually rather simple.

00:01:17.615 --> 00:01:20.975
It starts with identifying the vulnerability,

00:01:20.975 --> 00:01:25.190
analyzing it, and then taking some action.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.780
Identification is just knowing that something could be a problem.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.200
Analysis is the decision what to do about it,

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.230
and taking action is implementing that decision.
