00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
For this exercise, you reviewed domain ownership for udacity.com.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.330
Let me show you how it looks on domaintools.com.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.470
Each IP address and domain on the internet has an owner.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.725
This is the organization or person who registered it.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:22.575
In the exercise you practiced viewing ownership of internet domains and IP addresses.

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:25.875
For example, udacity.com.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:28.590
If you go to whois.domaintools.com,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.745
you can enter any URL you want to find out who owns it.

00:00:32.745 --> 00:00:36.285
Let's see who owns udacity.com.

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:40.950
The Whois record for udacity.com then appears.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.970
You can see who registered it,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.900
when it was registered,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.940
their domain name servers,

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.690
contact information, IP addresses, and their history.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.315
This is a wealth of information about a particular website,

00:00:56.315 --> 00:01:00.260
all available from the domaintools.com.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:06.660
Whois lookup.I recommend you practice on this using other domains.
