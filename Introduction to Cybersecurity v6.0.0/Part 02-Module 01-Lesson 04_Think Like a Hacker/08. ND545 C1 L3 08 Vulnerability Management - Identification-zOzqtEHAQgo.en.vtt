00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.475
Let's start with identification.

00:00:02.475 --> 00:00:05.519
The first step in the vulnerability management process.

00:00:05.519 --> 00:00:07.409
Where do you find vulnerabilities,

00:00:07.409 --> 00:00:11.190
flaws or deficiencies in IT or anywhere else?

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.715
I'll use a car analogy to explain it.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:19.950
Where do you see potential problems with an old car? Well, let's think about it.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:24.690
Maybe it's like bald tires or old breaks,

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:28.410
or if there's a manufacturer recall.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.830
Now let's look at vulnerabilities in information technology.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.720
There could be some within code or software applications.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.540
Our networks could allow a hacker to be able to come into

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.135
the internal network or unpatched systems could allow malware or other type of viruses.

00:00:49.135 --> 00:00:52.820
Where do you find software vulnerabilities in IT?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:54.950
How do you learn about them?

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.170
Well, there's a large community

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.550
dedicated to finding vulnerabilities and letting others know.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.884
These sources include vendors,

00:01:02.884 --> 00:01:06.350
for example, Microsoft with their Patch Tuesday.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.870
Many software vendors are very diligent

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.435
in letting their clients know if there's a problem.

00:01:11.435 --> 00:01:14.740
It's like carton manufacturers recall notice.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.870
Another place you can learn about weaknesses or vulnerabilities

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.160
are vulnerability lists and databases.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.575
There are websites that contain large amounts of information about known vulnerabilities.

00:01:27.575 --> 00:01:32.630
During the exercise, you'll see two websites that contain these lists.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.345
One of them is the NIST National Vulnerability Database, or NVD.

00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.525
The other is from a company called MITRE the

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:45.860
Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure, or CVE list.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.190
You'll learn more about these in the exercise.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.175
Another place you can learn about vulnerabilities or even take part is called Bug Bounty.

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:58.805
Bug Bounty programs, our coders and white hat hackers

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:03.085
search for vulnerabilities and get paid if they find any.

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:07.984
Last, vulnerabilities are often identified during security assessments.

00:02:07.984 --> 00:02:11.995
You are the person tasked into looking at the security of your IT.

00:02:11.995 --> 00:02:14.750
May see a potential vulnerability and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.020
how you configured your operating system or network.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.310
These are specific to your operating system or environment.
