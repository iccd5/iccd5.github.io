00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
During the project, you'll spend a day in the life of a

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.914
security professional dealing with a potential security incident.

00:00:07.914 --> 00:00:11.950
You'll leverage everything you've learned throughout the course to

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.270
answer pressing questions from your Chief Information Security Officer,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.145
which is usually the head leader of security in the work environment.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:24.655
Throughout the project, you will summarize and profile a threat,

00:00:24.655 --> 00:00:27.920
you'll conduct a real vulnerability scan,

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:32.620
you'll analyze results and recommend a remediation strategy,

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:37.255
you'll leverage penetration testing tactics to crack passwords,

00:00:37.255 --> 00:00:43.339
and finally you'll document the actions required to respond to the incident.
