It's not only about stopping data breaches.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.875

It can impact the world.

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.395
Think about finding threats and vulnerabilities to hospitals,

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:26.220
to autonomous vehicles, to nuclear facilities.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.655
This stuff can become life or death and it's not an easy industry to navigate.

00:00:31.655 --> 00:00:35.020
Attacks are endless and everyday is different,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.200

00:00:43.865 --> 00:00:45.800

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.240
I'm rooting for you,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.190
and I wish you the best of luck in this course.
