00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Threats have been around long before any of us walked this earth,

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.205
and as long as we exist and advance as humanity,

00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:11.835
the threats we face will only continue to evolve,

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:15.105
so we have to be ready for that always.

00:00:15.105 --> 00:00:21.020
At some point, almost every security professional will have to answer questions like,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.820
what are the greatest cyber threats we should be concerned about as the world evolves,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.585
and how can we find and fix these advanced issues, and super important,

00:00:31.585 --> 00:00:34.400
how do we respond, not if,

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.630
but when we eventually face a security incident or breach?

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:41.690
I hope you're excited to dive into learning this area of

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.810
cybersecurity because it's an awesome skill set to build.
