00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
During this course, you'll learn all about how to assess threats,

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.965
find and fix vulnerabilities,

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.985
and prepare for inevitable attacks.

00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:14.840
In Lesson 1, we'll be talking about assessing threats.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.585
So here you'll be able to explain the relationship between threats,

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:23.070
threat actors, vulnerabilities and exploits,

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.860
utilize event contexts to identify potential threat actor motivations,

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:35.055
identify security threats applicable to important organizational assets and finally,

00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:38.415
use standard formulas to assess threats,

00:00:38.415 --> 00:00:41.425
identify risks, and prioritize.

00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:46.245
During Lesson 2, we're going to discuss finding vulnerabilities.

00:00:46.245 --> 00:00:48.980
So here you'll be able to leverage

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.760
the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework to understand attack methods.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.580
You'll also configure and launch scans to find

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.685
vulnerabilities and explain the steps required to conduct a penetration test.

00:01:00.685 --> 00:01:05.355
During Lesson 3, we'll be going over how to fix vulnerabilities.

00:01:05.355 --> 00:01:09.280
You'll be able to conduct vulnerability research,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.540
also validate scan results through

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.320
manual testing and the application of business context.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.760
You'll learn how to prioritize security gaps discovered and recommend

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.015
remediation strategies and also conduct

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:27.415
vulnerability research using industry resources like MITRE CVE.

00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:29.605
Finally, in Lesson 4,

00:01:29.605 --> 00:01:33.260
we'll talk about how to prepare for inevitable attacks.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.375
You'll be able to explain the relationship between incident response,

00:01:38.375 --> 00:01:41.800
disaster recovery, and business continuity.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.515
You'll also learn to distinguish events from

00:01:45.515 --> 00:01:49.840
incidents and recognize indicators of compromise.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.740
You'll be able to explain the incident response life-cycle and finally,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.890
recognize the key incident response team roles

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.220
and core components of an incident response plan.
