00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
Though most vulnerability scanning tools simply show you

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.850
the CVSS score so you don't have to manually calculate them yourself,

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.275
it's important to understand how these scores are generated.

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.865
It helps you both understand how bad some gaps might be,

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:21.390
as well as score things yourself if you manually find

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.145
a vulnerability for which a CVSS score hasn't been assigned.

00:00:26.145 --> 00:00:30.600
The first half of the page here shows the scoring dashboard.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.090
It's empty now because we haven't selected anything,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.535
but you'll see it change as we do.

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:39.795
In the second half of the page,

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:45.350
this shows the sections for each of the scoring factor categories that we discussed.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.690
This feed the overall score.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.780
You have your bass section, your temporal section,

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.490
and your environmental section,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.800
again, just as we discussed.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.115
If you look at the base section, for example,

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:04.020
you'll see that a lot of the different factors play into how it's scores,

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:05.970
everything from the attack vector.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.330
If you look at the boxes underneath,

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.295
you'll see what the options are for that.

00:01:10.295 --> 00:01:14.600
I'll show there's a quick trick here to just hover over

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.820
the astrix and that will give you

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.585
a description of what each is if you want to learn more information.

00:01:20.585 --> 00:01:23.680
Attack vector is really how this attack happens.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.490
It can happen over the network if you hover over that and see more information as well,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.010
it can happen over adjacent networks,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.035
local and so on.

00:01:33.035 --> 00:01:38.350
Basically everything that you select here then populates that score.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.020
I'm just going to put in some basic tests selections

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.510
here just to show what a score would look like.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:46.865
Let's say for user interaction,

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:50.900
none is required and we'll say the scope has changed.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.480
We're just putting in a couple of examples here.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:54.750
It talks about impacts.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.230
How does this impact confidentiality?

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.255
Let's say the impact is high for that,

00:01:59.255 --> 00:02:04.580
but it's low for integrity and let's say it's high for availability, whatever that is.

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.020
Deciding on those things, again,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.835
depends on the vulnerability.

00:02:07.835 --> 00:02:13.384
But once we've selected those things for all of the sections below,

00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:16.260
that's when the score actually populates.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.380
Again, every one of those selections contributes to the number.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.630
What you have here is a depiction of the scoring

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.565
for each of the different categories across each domain.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.410
Then finally, you have an overall score,

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.880
which is probably the most important thing that you'll see across various tools.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.190
You have this overall score,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.680
in this case, is 6.7.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.910
But one differentiator I want to explain is you'll see a lot of use of this base score,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.580
and the difference between bass and overall is that the base score

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.675
takes into account only details about the vulnerability specifically,

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:59.600
while the temporal score and environmental score that contributes to this overall score

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.345
take into account context around

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:06.460
timing that's required and enterprises actual environment.

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.770
This part can change and be somewhat subjective,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.590
but this is the part that is usually pretty consistent,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.230
and so you get an overall score.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.235
The other thing that is important to note here is this severity vector string.

00:03:21.235 --> 00:03:25.910
This string here, you'll see across different vulnerability reports,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.430
you'll see it in different tools,

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:30.980
and so it's a common thing to keep in mind.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.610
What this does is summarize all of the selections that

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.020
come from these tables because you might not have this in every report.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.420
If we break this down and look into it even more,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.705
I'm going to zoom in so that you can see this string more.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:48.765
The first three letters are AVP,

00:03:48.765 --> 00:03:52.580
and if you look at this section right here on attack vector,

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:59.225
you'll see the abbreviation is AV and physical is P, so it's AVP.

00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:04.040
You can tell from this string that from an exploitability standpoint,

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:07.790
the attack vector is physical and each of these sections between

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.620
the slashes is associated with one of these categories.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.300
Let's say we wanted to find this,

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:15.920
its confidentiality is high,

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.355
CH, and so that matches up.

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:24.925
The next string here in this section is CH in terms of confidentiality impact being high.

00:04:24.925 --> 00:04:28.820
That's how you can read vector strings to learn more

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.290
about how severe or more details on vulnerability in general.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:35.660
That's a high level overview of how to use

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.080
this framework and I encourage you again to go through this,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.300
play around with it, hover over the boxes,

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.400
and learn more about each one of them means,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.920
because it'll help you understand vulnerabilities better.
