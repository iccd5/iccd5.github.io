00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Now you need to take all of this and communicate it to the right stakeholders.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.460
Note that the security professional who does

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.255
the scan may not be the person who fixes the issue.

00:00:12.255 --> 00:00:16.560
In fact, in my entire career as a vulnerability manager,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.730
I personally didn't fix majority of the issues I found.

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.165
I worked hand in hand with the engineers across the company to fix those issues.

00:00:26.165 --> 00:00:29.105
For example, if there was a firewall issue,

00:00:29.105 --> 00:00:33.620
I had to share an easy to understand reports of the findings,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.230
why it's important and the recommended fix with the engineering team.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:44.225
Information on the fix can be found in the scan report and through CVE research.

00:00:44.225 --> 00:00:47.945
But I also had to learn the corporate infrastructure

00:00:47.945 --> 00:00:51.880
to provide thoughtful and realistic recommendations.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.735
With that, they'd fixed the issue,

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:57.900
I would re-scan just to make sure it was fixed,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.075
and then they'd close it.

00:01:00.075 --> 00:01:02.835
Re-scanning is an important step.

00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:08.155
I also had someone fix one issue by changing a configuration,

00:01:08.155 --> 00:01:10.385
and when I ran the scan again,

00:01:10.385 --> 00:01:12.275
that old issue was fixed,

00:01:12.275 --> 00:01:16.675
but five new ones popped up and it almost became a game of whack-a-mole.

00:01:16.675 --> 00:01:20.675
So the cure should not be worse than the disease.

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:25.715
You may come out of your prioritization effort with some key realizations.

00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:29.240
There are things that it doesn't make sense to fix or that you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.055
can't fix right away and need a long-term plan.

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:37.925
This is where remediation strategy options matter as well.

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:41.870
So after your analysis and prioritization effort,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.505
you can decide on how you want to address each finding.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:49.790
You can choose to avoid the vulnerability by fixing the issue,

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.625
adding controls to mitigate the potential impact,

00:01:52.625 --> 00:01:55.944
or eliminating the asset altogether.

00:01:55.944 --> 00:01:58.919
You can accept the vulnerability,

00:01:58.919 --> 00:02:00.530
so essentially do nothing.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.225
But if you take this route,

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:05.330
the decision and justification should be

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.730
documented and signed off by an authorized individual.

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:13.830
Or you can transfer the impact elsewhere.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.835
For example, you can cover it through insurance or through vendor support.

00:02:18.835 --> 00:02:21.800
Sometimes software becomes obsolete, for example,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:28.080
and vendors offer special customized packages to help manage that vulnerability.
