00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
To prioritize the findings,

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.325
you have to understand the severity level,

00:00:05.325 --> 00:00:09.150
validate the findings, and remove false positives.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.880
You are focusing on what truly matters.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.645
There are resources available to help in this research,

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:19.035
including MITRE's CVE framework.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.860
Sometimes scans can detect things incorrectly,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.720
and so this helps.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.840
For example, I remember one day I conducted a scan trying to

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.720
find any traces of clear text credit card information in a corporate network.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.185
While it's not a software flaw per say that I was looking for,

00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:44.620
it's a violation of security policy and thus a gap that you want to find.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:51.215
I had programmed the technology to look for strings that looked like credit cards.

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:57.410
Something that's 16 digits usually doesn't start with a one or a zero, and so on.

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.925
I added all of those rules.

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.820
Now, you can imagine I scan

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.725
the terabytes of file storages looking for this type of string.

00:01:06.725 --> 00:01:10.520
Now because another common string in the company was

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.935
also 16 digits used for certain system IDs.

00:01:14.935 --> 00:01:19.380
I ended up with something like 200,000 alerts,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.365
and majority of them were false positives because they weren't credit card numbers.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:27.680
It's important to weed those out before you

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.560
try to fix things that aren't even an issue to begin with.
