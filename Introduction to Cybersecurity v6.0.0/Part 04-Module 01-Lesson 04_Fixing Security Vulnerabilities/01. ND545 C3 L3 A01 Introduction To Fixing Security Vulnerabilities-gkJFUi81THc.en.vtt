00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.205
The purpose of security testing is to find security gaps.

00:00:04.205 --> 00:00:07.215
To prevent attackers from exploiting those,

00:00:07.215 --> 00:00:09.280
they now have to be fixed.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.140
Remediation planning helps security professionals understand

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.205
and prioritize which vulnerabilities matter most.

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:19.900
Not only is this good security practice,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.215
but it can help save companies tons of legal and financial troubles in the long run.

00:00:26.215 --> 00:00:27.890
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.265
you'll be able to conduct vulnerability research

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:35.515
using industry resources like Mitre's CVE framework.

00:00:35.515 --> 00:00:38.180
You'll be able to validate scan results through

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.720
manual testing and apply business contexts,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.660
and you'll also be able to prioritize security gaps

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.590
discovered and recommend remediation strategies. Now let's jump right in.
