00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.685
Strengthening a system requires closing any holes or weaknesses,

00:00:04.685 --> 00:00:06.485
and you do this every day.

00:00:06.485 --> 00:00:11.280
If air is leaking out of a tire and you realize it may go flat,

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.110
you might patch the hole,

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.360
or if you're on a boat and there's water seeping through a hole in the bottom,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.670
you might plug it to keep water out.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.020
These are fixes meant to mitigate a vulnerability.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.530
This same principle applies in Cybersecurity.

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.765
System vulnerabilities need to be fixed to stop them from being exploited.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:38.370
However, the challenge as you search for vulnerabilities is that you may find

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.355
hundreds or thousands of issues and it's impossible to fix them all.

00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:47.660
You have to start asking tough questions to prioritize.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.105
Let's dig into the boat example.

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:53.140
Let's say there are three holes in the boat.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.130
One is pretty small,

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.720
but in the center of the floor,

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.690
and about a gallon of water leaks in per hour.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.765
The other two holes are very large,

00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:04.400
but they're on the sides of the boat,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.405
so a gallon leaks in maybe every five hours.

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:10.805
Do you patch the biggest hole first?

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.445
Without context, you might say yes.

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:17.705
But since there's more water coming in over time through the smaller one,

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:19.685
do you patch that one first?

00:01:19.685 --> 00:01:23.195
Do you have enough capacity to patch all of them at once?

00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:27.080
These are the questions that you'd start to consider to determine,

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.475
what to fix first?

00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:32.105
Who should fix it? When they should fix it and how?

00:01:32.105 --> 00:01:35.910
This is essentially remediation management.
