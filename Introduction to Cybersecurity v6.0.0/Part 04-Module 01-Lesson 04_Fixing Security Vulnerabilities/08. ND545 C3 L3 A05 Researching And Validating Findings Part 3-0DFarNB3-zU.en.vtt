00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
One way to research and learn more about

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.510
vulnerabilities is through MITRE's CVE framework.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:12.420
We're going to do a quick introduction to this and tie everything we've learned together.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.770
Now, if you wanted to do a search within this framework,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.050
you can either search by keyword,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.445
or you can search by the specific CVE if that is known.

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:28.290
Let's say we're looking for vulnerabilities associated with brute-force attacks.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.055
If we type in bruteforce and hit "Enter",

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:39.905
you get a list of different brute-force related vulnerabilities and descriptions.

00:00:39.905 --> 00:00:43.360
Now you can click into each one to learn more, of course.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.240
Let's say we wanted to click on the most recent one because as you can see,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.430
they're labeled by year.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.140
If we click into this one,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.820
I know there's a lot of information here,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.355
but we can zone in on the things that matter the most.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:57.635
You have the CVE-ID,

00:00:57.635 --> 00:01:02.060
which is the common identifier across all platforms.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.590
You have a description here.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:08.255
In this case, this ID looks like it's associated with an API

00:01:08.255 --> 00:01:13.035
that doesn't implement measures that prevent account lockout.

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:15.260
Basically, an attacker can try

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.055
different passwords in unlimited amount of time with no consequences.

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:20.470
That's the issue here.

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.990
You can check the references section to see more links

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.760
and more information that can help you research this,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:34.280
and you can see that it was created on this date in February of 2020,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.320
and so you know when it came out.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.720
But one of the most important elements of tying the CVE back to

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.405
what you've learned so far is linking over to the National Vulnerability Database.

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:48.755
If you click this link,

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:52.690
it takes you over to the National Vulnerability Database.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.830
What you can find in here is

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.655
a lot more information related to the calculator that you learned about.

00:01:58.655 --> 00:02:00.740
You have the CVE number here,

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.850
which again is important,

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.875
you have the description,

00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:07.195
but here it ties in that severity rating.

00:02:07.195 --> 00:02:12.680
Here you can see the base score we talked about is a 7.5, so it's high.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.435
If you click on this,

00:02:14.435 --> 00:02:16.850
you get taken back to the calculator.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.640
You can look into some of the details there,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.560
and you can begin to, again,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.234
if you wanted to add some context relevant to your company,

00:02:25.234 --> 00:02:27.470
you can begin to add some of that in to see

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.725
a more accurate score for what you're dealing with.

00:02:30.725 --> 00:02:35.450
Then another thing if we go back to the main page we were just on,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.730
is you'll recognize this vector string that we talked about as well.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.770
You can start to see what different requirements and elements are included in the score.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.300
Again, if you hover over,

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:49.290
you can also begin to see some of those details.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.930
Again, tying it all together and researching vulnerabilities in

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.140
the CVE MITRE framework to bringing it and

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.545
tying it into the CVSS score is really important.

00:03:00.545 --> 00:03:07.170
We'll go back to our Nessus scan results and tie this all together.

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.005
Back on this page,

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:12.790
you remember the list of vulnerabilities that we discovered.

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.545
If we look into the results we reviewed before,

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:18.725
we can click into that and get more information.

00:03:18.725 --> 00:03:23.605
Let's say we wanted to tie this back together to this medium finding here.

00:03:23.605 --> 00:03:25.320
If you click on that, you'll remember,

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.420
you can see the title,

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.650
you can see the severity,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.140
the description, and so on.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.300
But if you scroll over here all the way to the right,

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.780
you can tie this information back to what we just learned.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.500
Here you can automatically see what the CVSS scores are.

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:43.025
You can see that vector string straight from your results,

00:03:43.025 --> 00:03:49.785
and you can even go down and see the CVE-ID associated with this finding in Nessus.

00:03:49.785 --> 00:03:52.805
This is an example of how you can tie

00:03:52.805 --> 00:03:56.135
the research tools that are out there from MITRE and from

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:58.880
other sources back to scan results in

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.945
the actual scanner that you are using to make this a lot easier.

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:06.680
That's how you can conduct research on vulnerabilities

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.520
using the MITRE CVE framework and tie it back to your scan results.
