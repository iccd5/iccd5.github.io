00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
When it comes to validating vulnerabilities,

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:06.795
there are three commonly used terms in the industry you should know.

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:08.805
Those are false negative,

00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:12.485
false positive, and true positive.

00:00:12.485 --> 00:00:16.170
A false negative is an instance in which a security tool

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.980
intended to detect a particular threat fails to do so.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.815
If there's a fire and smoke everywhere,

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:24.660
but the alarm remain silent,

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.445
that's a false negative,

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.800
and the same applies in technology.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.665
For example, if your computer is missing several security patches,

00:00:33.665 --> 00:00:36.415
but your vulnerability scanner doesn't detect it,

00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:38.360
that's a false negative.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.810
A false positive is an alert that incorrectly indicates that a vulnerability is present.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:50.180
If your fire alarm goes off when there is no smoke or no fire,

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.100
that's a false positive,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.860
and the same happens in technology as well.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.085
For example, if your vulnerability scanner detects

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:01.940
a weak encryption algorithm that's being used on the system,

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.275
but when you double-check,

00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:05.584
that algorithm is already disabled,

00:01:05.584 --> 00:01:08.530
that's considered a false positive.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.615
Finally, a true positive is an alert

00:01:11.615 --> 00:01:14.990
that rightfully indicates a vulnerability is present.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.140
Finally, if there is a fire and smoke everywhere and the alarm does go off,

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.740
that's a true positive,

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.245
so it's doing exactly what it should do.

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:28.020
The same applies in technology as well.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.850
For example, if your password is 12345 and the scanner detects that,

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.990
hey, you have weak password, it's absolutely right.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.640
That is a true positive.
