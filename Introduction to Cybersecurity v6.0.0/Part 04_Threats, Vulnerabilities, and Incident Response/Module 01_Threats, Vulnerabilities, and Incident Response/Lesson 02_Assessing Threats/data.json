To avoid attacks, security professionals must understand these factors and how they contribute to security failures. After this lesson, you’ll be able to explain the relationship between threats, threat actors, vulnerabilities, and exploits. You’ll also understand the threat assessment lifecycle.\n\nThe number of cyber threats to organizations is limitless. From hackers looking to steal data, to a flood that destroys data on computers, there are a variety of threats companies worry about. In addition, all threats are not created equally. Some are worse than others. Some don’t matter at all. Threat assessment is the process that helps organizations navigate the complex and dynamic world of cybersecurity threats.\n\nThreat assessment is a subset of the overall risk management process. Before doing a threat assessment, you must understand the environment, inventory assets, know what’s important to the company.",

Prioritize which threats matter most based on what is important to the organization.\n\nThe ultimate goal of a threat assessment is to begin answering the following questions:\n1. What are the relevant threats that could impact the organization's information technology assets?\n2. Which threats represent the gravest danger to the company?\n3. Which threats have the greatest likelihood of leading to a successful negative outcome?\n4. Is the organization prepared to mitigate the threats? If not, what actions should be taken to mitigate the threat?",

Also, the potential for a threat-source to successfully exploit a particular information system vulnerability.\n\n• **Threat assessment**: Process of formally evaluating the degree of threat to an information system or enterprise and describing the nature of the threat.\n\n• **Vulnerability**: Weakness in an information system, system security procedures, internal controls, or implementation that could be exploited or triggered by a threat source.\n\n• **Exploit**: A code, tool, or mechanism that takes advantage of a vulnerability in a system in an attempt to breach security.\n\n• **Attack**: Any kind of malicious activity that attempts to collect, disrupt, deny, degrade, or destroy information system resources or the information itself.\n\n• **Controls**: A safeguard or countermeasure prescribed for an information system or an organization designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its information and to meet a set of defined security requirements.\n\n• **Risk**: The level of impact on organizational operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, or individuals resulting from the operation of an information system given the potential impact of a threat and the likelihood of that threat occurring.\n\nDefinitions from the NIST CSRC Glossary: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary\n\n",

From well-known security gaps to zero-day challenges, organizations are faced with thousands of threats that security professionals must understand. A threat can also be intentional, unintentional, or otherwise a circumstance, capability, action, or event. Understanding the various threat types is fundamental as this is how you begin to brainstorm and identify threats that may apply to the company.\n\nAfter this lesson you’ll understand various threat types.",

Here are some examples:\n\n•\tDenial of Service (DoS): Attacks that prevent authorized access to resources create delays in access, usually done by sending fake web traffic, for example, to overwhelm the resource.\n\n•\tDistributed Denial of Service (DDoS): A denial of service technique that leverages several hosts to send traffic to the target host and overwhelm the resource.\n\n•\tPassword Attacks: Also know as password cracking, these attacks are used to recover passwords or authentication credentials.\n\n•\tSpoofing: Impersonating a user or device by using a fake IP address to send a message and trick the user into trusting the fake sender.\n\n•\tMan in the Middle: Intercepting a connection between two devices off users, and potentially changing the messages being sent. \n\n•\tMalware: Software that includes malicious code that is harmful to computer resources.\n\n•\tRansomware: A variant of malware that encrypts the victims data, and threatens to hold the decryption key and data hostage until a payment is made.\n\n•\tZero-day is a flaw in software that is very new. It may refer to the software flaw, or an attack method that has zero days between the date the flaw is discovered and the date of the first attack.\n\n•\tAnd countless others!\n",

Most hack attempts require action from a person, in order for them to be successful. This is called social engineering.\nSocial Engineering: An attempt to trick someone into revealing information (e.g., a password) that can be used to attack systems or networks.\n\nExamples of Social Engineering Tactics:\n\n•\tPhishing: A technique for attempting to acquire sensitive data, such as bank account numbers, through a fraudulent solicitation in email or on a web site, in which the perpetrator masquerades as a legitimate business or reputable person.\n\n•\tVishing: Phishing executed via voice call.\n\n•\tSmishing: Phishing executed via SMS or text message.\n\n•\tSpear phishing: A colloquial term that can be used to describe any highly targeted phishing attack.\n\n•\tWhaling: A specific kind of phishing that targets high-ranking members of organizations.\n",

Sometimes, you’ll find multiple motivations exist in one threat actor or group, making it hard to pinpoint the exact intent of an attack. When this is the case, it’s important to note your hypothesis and theories, but don’t get too hung up on it. Remember that in threat assessment, a lot of the work is hypothesizing and building theories based on research. There are a lot of variables and sometimes unclear answers, and that’s okay. Also, some threat actors try to use obvious motivations as smoke screens for a hidden agenda. For example, sometimes attackers launch ransomware attacks, not for the financial gain of the ransom, but to encrypt and hide their activity on the target network. What would appear to be a financially motivated threat actor, could be espionage or some totally different. ",

The assessments follow a standard process that includes identifying, analyzing, and prioritizing threats.\n\n## Identify\n\nThe identification stage includes leverage available information about the business environment and company to start identifying potential threats. The process consists of a combination of brainstorming and using available resources to discover threats both proactively or reactively. Typical activities included in this phase are:\n- Threat Detection: The ability to detect threats proactively or reactively in an environment.\n- Threat Hunting: Proactively combing through networks to find advanced and undetected threats that may bypass typical security controls and detection technology.\n- Threat Actor Discovery: Leverage threat intelligence and other information sources to identify potential threat actors that may impact your business.\n\n## Analyze\n\nDuring the analysis phase, you’ll gather detail and information about the threats you’ve identified and understand how they might apply to your organization. Typical activities included in this phase are:\n\n- Threat Intelligence Gathering: Threat information that has been aggregated, transformed, analyzed, interpreted, or enriched to provide the necessary context for decision-making processes.\n- Threat Profiling and Modeling: Analytical insights into trends, technologies, or tactics of an adversarial nature affecting information systems security.\n- Threat Scenario Development: A set of discrete threat events, associated with a specific threat source or multiple threat sources, partially ordered in time.\n\n## Prioritize\n\nDuring the final step of prioritization, you consider the variables that matter to the company to determine the most significant threats. Typical activities included in this phase are impact assessment and application of context. As you prioritize the threats based on impact and additional context, you may ask questions like:\n\n- What’s the likelihood that this threat will impact our business?\n- How can this threat impact the business?\n- What controls are in place to mitigate the impact, if any?\n\nReference: [NIST Computer Resource Center](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary)",

The framework focuses on advanced threats and corresponding elements of organizational strategy, and also includes coverage of conventional cyber threats. This can serve as a basis for profiling threats. The framework considers threats based on 3 main characteristics: Intent, Target, and Capabilities\n\n### Intent\n\n- Goal: At what scope or in what arena does the adversary operate? Depending on their goals, an adversary can operate against a subset of the organization’s systems (e.g., its external-facing services); the organization’s operations; the organization’s associates (customers, users, or partners); the organization’s critical infrastructure or industry sector; or the nation. Example goals here are tied back to the threat actors and motivations learned in this lesson.\n\n- Consequence: How much of an impact would successful achievement of adversary goals have? How much disruption would adversary activities cause? \n- Limited or near-term: Will have little or no impact on critical mission operations. Consequences can be handled within an operational planning or funding cycle (e.g., within a business quarter) or within the duration of a mission operation. \n- Extensive or mid-term: Will have significant impact on critical mission operations, the organization, or its associates. Consequences require remediation or mitigation efforts that extend across operational planning or funding cycles. \n- Severe or long-term: Will have extremely significant, potentially catastrophic impact on mission operations, the organization, or its associates. Consequences are of a duration or extent that must be considered by strategic planning. \n-  Timeframe: In what timeframe does the adversary operate? Will the adversary’s activities be periodic or episodic, or will the adversary commit to a sustained effort against the organization? \n\n### Target\n\nExpanding on the goal of the attack, who or what is the target? The organization might also consider whether it could be an indirect target. Which of our customers or partners could be high-value targets for an adversary? \n\n### Capability\n\nWhat are the likely capabilities and resources of the adversary? Are they minimal, causing the adversary to employ existing, known, malware? Or are they significant, allowing the adversary the benefit of being able to create their own malware, threat vectors, and possibly introduce vulnerabilities into the organization? \n\n\nReference: https://www.mitre.org/sites/default/files/publications/15-0797-cyber-prep-2-motivating-organizational-cyber-strategies.pdf",

This process varies from company to company, however common elements to consider include: \n1. The likelihood that the threat will surface.\n2. The potential impact if the threat is successful at achieving its goal.\n3. The controls that are in place to mitigate the threat.\n\nThe organization also determines a score or rating, such as High, Medium, Low or using a scale of 1-10, in each of the category. For example, a threat that is surely going to cause a loss of life might be scored high in impact. In the same company, a threat that will result in a loss of $1 might be ranked low. This context is then used to rank threats. \n\nIn many organizations, this information then feeds the risk management process and it’s important to keep the scoring consistent throughout the process. \n",
