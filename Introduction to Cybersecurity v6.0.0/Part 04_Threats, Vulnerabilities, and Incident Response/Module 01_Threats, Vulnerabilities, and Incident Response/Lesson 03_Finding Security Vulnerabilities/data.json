Reconnaissance: The threat actor conducts research to find as much information as possible on the targets they want to attack, including vulnerabilities and weaknesses.\n2. Weaponization: The threat actor creates or acquires the arsenal for attack, such as malware. \n3. Delivery: The weapon is launched against the target and the operation begins.\n4. Exploitation: The threat actor must take advantage of vulnerability to gain access.\n5. Installation: The threat actor might install a backdoor or create ways to keep their access for the attack. \n6. Command and control: The threat actor enables remote control and manipulation of the target. \n7.

The dynamic application scans test functionality while the program is executing operations, while static scans test functionality without running any code.\n\n**Penetration testing** is another level of actively trying to see if you can essentially break security.

Nessus, the tools used in this class for example, is an open-source scanner that uses the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) model to find issues and efficiently conduct further research and analysis on the findings.\n\nTo run a scan, you'll need to identify the target you want to scan and establish what kinds of security issues you are seeking to find.

              "text": "## Overview\n\nThe ultimate test of security is to put yourself in the shoes of an attacker and test your own system. This section covers how to organize and conduct a penetration test.  While from prior sections we've learned that there are many attack types hackers can choose from, we'll focus on password attacks as an example.\n\nPenetration testing, also known as pen testing, is a method of vulnerability discovery where ethical hackers target a resource to determine whether vulnerabilities can be exploited to compromise and environment or asset. These tests can target all resources from technology devices and networks, to physical offices and even employees via social engineering tests.\n\n## Red Team vs Blue Team\n\nPenetration tests include two sides that are categorized as teams. One side is the offensive team (red team) who are pretending to be the “bad” actors launching attacks. The other is the defensive team (blue team) who is acting as the “good” side trying to prevent attacks.\n\n## Penetration Testing Approaches\n\nPenetration tests are also characterized by how the red team approaches testing and how much insider knowledge is available to them. Typically, the less knowledge the penetration tester has, the more realistic the simulation is because attacks don’t usually know everything about a network they are targeting in the beginning. However, note that insider threats sometimes launch attacks as well and will have internal knowledge. The main testing approach are:\n\n-\tWhite box testing: A test methodology that assumes explicit and substantial knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object.\n\n-\tBlack box testing: A test methodology that assumes no knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object.\n\n-\tGray box testing: A test methodology that assumes some knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object.\n\nDefinitions from the NIST CSRC Glossary: https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/",

              "text": "## Penetration Test Example: Password Cracking using Dictionary Attack Mode\n\nAn example penetration test component that may be carried out, is a password cracking test.\n\nPassword cracking is the process of guessing, recovering, or reverse calculating a secret password stored in a computer system or transmitted over a network. It’s like picking a lock on a virtual door.\n\n**There are many approaches available to cracking a password:**\n\n•\tBrute Force Attack - The attacker tries every possible password combination until one works.\n\n•\tDictionary password attack – The attacker uses a dictionary list of common user passwords in a hashed format, and compares it to a password hash list \"stolen\" from a system. For example the MD5 hash for password123 is 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38. If that string is found in system password file, it means that a user has their password set to \"password123\".\n\n•\tSocial engineering password  - Attackers who pretend to be employees try to get access to systems information by asking other employees for their usernames and passwords. Once they successfully get the credentials from the employees, they'll try to use the information to gain access to the company's systems. \n\n## Password Cracking Tools\n\nWeak passwords can be cracked in a matter of seconds using password cracking technology like HashCat (open source). Within HashCat, there are four components of basic attack:\n\n(hash type) (attack mode) (hash file) (dictionary file)\n\n## Example Command\n\nTo crack a password using a dictionary attack type, for example, you may specify this  command ** -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt file.txt** which translates into the following arguments:\n\n-\tHash type: - m 0 \n-\tAttack mode: -a 0\n-\tHash file: hash.txt\n-\tDictionary file:  file.dict\n\nTranslated example of command: -m 0 -a 0 hash.txt file.dict\n\n- -m 0 represents the hash type MD5\n\n- -a 0 represents to dictionary attack mode\n\n- -hash.txt and  secret.dict represent the target files\n\nCheck out the help section of the site to access source code, introductory videos, and more https://hashcat.net/hashcat/ \n\nSyntax for additional hash types can be found here: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes\n\nIf you’d like to learn more about HashCAT, here’s a good intro video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfqJCKWtGiU",

However, there are also times when penetration testing may not be the best answer, or extra precautions should be taken. For example, Black Friday in the U.S is one of the biggest sales days for retailers. A retail company may not want to conduct a penetration test against the company website during this time since this activity could potentially take down services. It’s also important to outline rules of engagement with testers to provide guidance on just how far attackers can go. For example, if the test can hack the site and gain access to shut it down, should they stop there and notify you? Or should they keep going and actually try to shut it down? The bottom line is that planning a penetration test at the right time and with the right rules is important. In between, leverage vulnerability scanning and manual testing to continue finding issues with less potential impact. ",

This is basically a hashed list of common passwords you can use to try to match up a password.\n\nThere are tools and scripts that can be written to automate this as you advance, however we’ll create the list manually so that you fundamentally understand how password cracking works. Let’s say the base keyword you choose is “password”. You’d create variations based on that because people tend to use common words and then add a few numbers or special characters. So, if you know your targets favorite color, or kids name, and other details like that this list can grow to include all kinds of combinations you might come up with, but here’s my example for the base word password. \n\nCleartext password list:\npassword\nPassword\npassword1\nPassword1\npassword123\nPassword123\nPassword123*\nP@Ssword\nP@$$word123\n\nAlso, if you know what the required length, casing, number, and special character rules are, you can create a more efficient list as an attacker. \n\nNow that you have this list, it’s still not all you need. Remember that systems don't typically store passwords in clear text. Once you have your list of passwords you think might be right, you’ll need to hash them.\n\nHere’s example hash output using MD5 hashing.\n5F4DCC3B5AA765D61D8327DEB882CF99\nDC647EB65E6711E155375218212B3964\n7C6A180B36896A0A8C02787EEAFB0E4C\n2AC9CB7DC02B3C0083EB70898E549B63\n482C811DA5D5B4BC6D497FFA98491E38\n42F749ADE7F9E195BF475F37A44CAFCB\nCBE10224496FB0BE0B7CA5178C932822\n175526654E72D88C37F1A630F1A976E2\n8B9674B89FE74D7F57A733AFB0F0D566\nFD32F63A223767E782A003C7985AF225\n\nThat becomes your dictionary file for the attack.

For example, you can target a certain data center looking for a specific set of issues, a specific application, or other reasons. |\n| Identify | Pinpoint the specific host, network, application, or other resource targets. Here you may identify specific IP addresses or URLs for example. |\n| Scan | Configure and run the scan or test against the identified target. Here you are using various tools and methods, such as vulnerability scanning software, to find the issues. |\n| Host and network vulnerability scans | Used to find vulnerabilities on servers, desktop, mobile devices, etc. within a network. Active vulnerability scanning used to traffic and actions to identify vulnerabilities. Passive scanning listens on the system and identifies issues in server and client software. |\n| Application vulnerability scans | Target security within code and its operation. The dynamic application scans test functionality while the program is executing operations, while static scans test functionality without running any code. |\n| Penetration testing | Another level of actively trying to see if you can essentially break security. Penetration tests can target networks, hosts, people, and physical assets. |\n| White box testing | A test methodology that assumes explicit and substantial knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. |\n| Black box testing | A test methodology that assumes no knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. |\n| Gray box testing | A test methodology that assumes some knowledge of the internal structure and implementation detail of the assessment object. |\n| Brute Force Attack | The attacker tries every possible password combination until one works. |\n| Dictionary password attack | The attacker uses a dictionary list of common user passwords in a hashed format, and compares it to a password hash list \"stolen\" from a system.|\n| Social engineering password | Attackers who pretend to be employees try to get access to systems information by asking other employees for their usernames and passwords. Once they successfully get the credentials from the employees, they'll try to use the information to gain access to the company's systems. |\n",
