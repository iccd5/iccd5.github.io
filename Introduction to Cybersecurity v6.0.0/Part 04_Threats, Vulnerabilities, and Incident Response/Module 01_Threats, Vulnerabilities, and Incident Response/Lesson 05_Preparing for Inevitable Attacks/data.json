Eventually, something will go wrong, and it's important to prepare for that.\tCyber security breaches are on the rise and having a solid process for responding and containing the incident, can save companies millions of dollars in damages and prevent catastrophe. \tContingency Planning is the process of preparing a company to detect, react to, and recover from threats to assets. The main goal is to bring the company back to a state of normal operations following a disruptive event. \n\nThere are 3 key parts to contingency planning:\n\n**Incident Response:** The process of detecting and responding to to limit consequences of a malicious, unintentional, or circumstantial cyber attack against an organizationâ€™s information systems(s).\n\n**Business Continuity:** A predetermined process that describes how an organizationâ€™s mission/business processes will be sustained during and after a significant disruption.\n\n**Disaster Recovery:** A predetermined process that details how critical applications and processes will be restored to normal operations at the primary business site in the event of a major hardware or software failure or destruction of facilities.",

For example, sending a general security expert without specific DF expertise to assess a digital crime scene could result in the accidental deletion of evidence and more. A common misconception in DF is that forensics experts can look into anything and everything in the company when there is a cybercrime or breach. This is not the case. For example, if a df expert is brought in with a warrant to search an employee computer for evidence of digital fraud, that may be the only thing they have permission to search for. If they come across evidence of other unrelated activities, theyâ€™d have to get additional permission/warrants or revisit the scope of the investigation before gathering the evidence. One exception to this rule is in the discovery of child pornography, which is typically required to be reported to authorities immediately. The bottom line is that digital forensics efforts must be highly focused to ensure the right assets are investigated, and the appropriate evidence gathered.",

(Example: The investigator has pinpointed a suspicious IP address belonging to the laptop in Ohio. The digital forensics investigator may have a co-worker send them the suspected laptop for analysis.)\n\n- Preserving â€“ This is the practice of ensuring the integrity of the collected evidence and preserving a \"digital trail\" of the data or media. (Example: It's essential to monitor how the computer and any copies of data have been handled since being taken from the employee, along with who had access.)\n\n- Analyzing â€“ This is the investigative portion of the process where a forensics practitioner begins looking into the acquired asset or medias data to find evidence of the suspected crime. (Example: The investigator may look through documents, email and chat conversations, browser website history, hard drives, and other user activities.)\n\n- Reporting â€“ This is the process of creating a report of findings from the investigation for presentation to stakeholders and, in some cases, an attorney or jury in court. Reporting must also be tailored to the audience. In a court case where the jury is not technically savvy, findings must be explained in ways that are easy to understand for everyone. Failure to do so might render even the most irrefutable evidence ineffective. (Example: A digital forensics investigator may debrief a company's technical leaders in detail and then give a high-level summary to the general manager.)\n\nReference: https://blog.veriato.com/the-evolution-of-digital-forensics",

What materials might they be collecting in preparation?\n\nSimilar to physical crime scenes, criminals often leave behind tons of digital clues that can help shed light on criminal activity. Start by looking at obvious digital remnants like search history across the various browsers on the computer. Look at file download history. Check for auto login accounts that the user may still be signed in to. Look at recently deleted information. These are basic starting points. More advanced technology can be used to find hidden rootkits, carve out deleted files, pull metadata from images, and more. In this exercise case, after checking those items you can conclude they are planning a bank robbery. From the clues you can find the exact geo location of the bank they plan to rob within the web browser search history. You can also find the kinds of masks they might be wearing based on bookmarks. In the search history you may also realize that they are preparing to take hostages, and more.\n",

Eventually something will go wrong and it's important to prepare for that. Cyber security breaches are on the rise and having a solid process for responding and containing the incident, can save companies millions of dollars in damages and prevent catastrophe. That's what incident response is all about. At this point you now know: \n\n- The relationship between incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity\n- How to distinguish events from incidents and recognize indicators of compromise\n- The incident response lifecycle\n- Key incident response team roles and core components of an incident response plan\n",
