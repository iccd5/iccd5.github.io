00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
Being able to understand your scan results is important,

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.045
and that's the focus of this exercise.

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:11.235
So you're tasked with collecting details like what's the target IP address for the scan?

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:14.535
What are the findings and what are their severity levels?

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:19.780
As well as deeper details on ports discovered and key vulnerability publication dates.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.770
You're provided two files,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.600
one is the HTML results file and the other is a CSV file.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.720
Now if we start with the HTML file,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.250
this is what it looks like,

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.490
and you can see from this summary what the target host is.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.690
In this case, you can see a summary of the different vulnerabilities.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.755
You can see that we have two medium,

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:50.090
one low, and then 11 information or data points.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.330
So that's all very basic information that you can find

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.780
just in looking at this at face value.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.560
You can also click in here and see some additional details,

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.980
and also click further into some of these details if you'd like to see more information.

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.840
Now if we go over to the Excel file that you were provided,

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.045
you get even more information.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:17.735
We'll zoom in a little bit here just so it's easier to see.

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:20.510
Here's where you can find more specific details

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.420
and answers to some of the other questions that you are asked.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.330
So for example, there's a question about which TCP ports were discovered.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.150
If you look at the port column, you can see all of

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.475
the different ports that were discovered.

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:35.690
So you'll see there is 80,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.365
there is 53, there is 67.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:41.580
The other thing to look at is what protocol.

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:43.145
So if we're talking about TCP,

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:44.930
that might not apply to every port.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.300
So for example, 67 is UDP.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.530
So you can see from here the two TCP ports are 80 and 53, for example.

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.275
Then the other question was around the publication date.

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:03.860
So again, a lot of data here that you can filter and everything.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.290
But if you look at these last columns down here,

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.975
you find the relevant dates here.

00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:11.825
So based on this column,

00:02:11.825 --> 00:02:16.480
you can see that the question is about vulnerabilities in the year 2000.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.225
So if you look, you can see there's two line items that were discovered in the year 2000,

00:02:22.225 --> 00:02:27.180
one of them is informational and one is a medium, you can see here.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.260
So this is the vulnerability that we care about that was discovered in 2000.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.880
So if we scroll back over here,

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.545
you know what this issue is,

00:02:37.545 --> 00:02:39.590
and you see that as a medium severity again,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.530
you can see the CVE and so on.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.510
So that's how you would find the answers for this exercise.
