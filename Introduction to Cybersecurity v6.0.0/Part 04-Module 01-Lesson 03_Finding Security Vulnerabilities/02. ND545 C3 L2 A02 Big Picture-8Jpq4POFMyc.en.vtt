00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
Remember the quote from Sun Tzu.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.360
You have to know your enemy and know yourself.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.015
At this point, you've learned about your enemy and how to identify threats.

00:00:12.015 --> 00:00:14.700
Once you know what those threats are,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.615
the next step is to see if you are vulnerable to them.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:25.360
This will help you know yourself and know your weaknesses as you prepare for battle.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.135
Now vulnerabilities and threats go hand in hand.

00:00:29.135 --> 00:00:35.120
If a threat exists with no vulnerability or a vulnerability with no threat,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.495
most would say there really isn't an issue.

00:00:38.495 --> 00:00:44.240
For example, let's say a new security weakness was announced in a specific type of

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.850
bank vault's door and so if you go

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.420
to this bank vault door and putting the wrong code 10 times,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.755
it will assume you forgot the code and automatically offer you a resets.

00:00:54.755 --> 00:01:00.140
How helpful? Now, if a criminal group is moving throughout the city,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.800
robbing banks, that use that same vault technology,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.130
who should be most concerned?

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.350
Should a cashless bank without a vault to be

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.485
concerned about this particular threat? Maybe not.

00:01:12.485 --> 00:01:16.990
Should a bank with 10 of those vaults throughout the city be concerned?

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:22.295
Absolutely. When there is a threat and the vulnerability present,

00:01:22.295 --> 00:01:26.870
those are the people who are at risk and should be most concerned.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.300
This makes understanding the vulnerabilities that a threat actor can exploit critical.
