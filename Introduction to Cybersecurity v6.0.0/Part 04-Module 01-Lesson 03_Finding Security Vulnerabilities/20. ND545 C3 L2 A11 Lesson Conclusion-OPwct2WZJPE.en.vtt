00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
This lesson has been all about finding issues.

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:05.640
When you know your weaknesses,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.010
you are in a better position to turn them into

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.970
strings or at least make sure people can't exploit them.

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.880
At this point, you should be able to leverage

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.929
the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework to understand attack methods,

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.725
you should be able to configure and launch skins to find vulnerabilities,

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:26.250
and you know the steps required to conduct a penetration tests,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.650
and even crack a password.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.240
I encourage you to take some time to explore the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.280
exploring NASA scanner more,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.440
and explore Hashcat in your spare time.
