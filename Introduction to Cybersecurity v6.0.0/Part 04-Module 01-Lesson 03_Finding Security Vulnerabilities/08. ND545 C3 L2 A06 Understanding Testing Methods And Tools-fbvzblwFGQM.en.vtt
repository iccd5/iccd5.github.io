00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
Before we dive into focusing on vulnerability scanning and penetration testing,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.530
it's important to understand the overall vulnerability management process.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.635
It typically includes these eight phases.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:17.760
The first three are what contributes to finding gaps and

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.170
includes scoping, identifying, and scanning.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.395
The first is to set the scope,

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:30.100
so this is where you determine conceptually what you want to test.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.705
For example, you can target a certain datacenter looking for a specific set of issues,

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:39.305
a specific application or other reasons.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.260
Next is identify.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.890
Here, you pinpoint the specific host network application or other resource targets.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.630
At this point, you may identify specific IP addresses or URLs that you're targeting.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.370
The third step in finding gaps is to scan.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.815
You can figure and run the scan or test against the identified target.

00:01:05.815 --> 00:01:09.545
Here, you are using a variety of tools and methods such

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:13.460
as vulnerability scanning software to find the issues.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.460
We'll cover the remaining steps in greater depth in a later lesson.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.340
However, it's important to understand this overarching process up front.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.120
There are many different ways to find vulnerabilities.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.430
Two key categories are vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.980
On the vulnerability scanning side,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:40.730
host and network vulnerability scans are used to find security gaps on servers,

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:45.770
desktops, mobile devices, and more within a network.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.045
There are also different modes of vulnerability scanning.

00:01:49.045 --> 00:01:55.100
Active scanning uses real traffic and actions to identify vulnerabilities while

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.860
passive scanning listens on the network and

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.580
identifies issues in server and client software.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.745
Application vulnerability scanning targets security

00:02:05.745 --> 00:02:09.765
within AppCode and how the app operates.

00:02:09.765 --> 00:02:12.785
There are also different modes for app scanning as well.

00:02:12.785 --> 00:02:16.220
For example, dynamic application scans,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.130
test functionality while the program is executing operations.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:23.750
While static scanned on the other hand,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.705
test application functionality and security without executing any code at all.

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:31.775
Now regardless of mode,

00:02:31.775 --> 00:02:37.970
application vulnerability scans should be used to test new applications being developed,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.225
as well as to check for security issues after

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:45.230
a major code update or for ongoing maintenance.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.920
On the other end, penetration testing is

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.065
an additional level of actively aiming to essentially break your own security.

00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:58.220
Penetration tests can target anything from networks and

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.135
hosts to people, to physical assets.

00:03:03.135 --> 00:03:06.965
These types of tests should be conducted regularly as

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:12.545
a best practice and especially after any major changes to network configurations,

00:03:12.545 --> 00:03:16.110
such as firewalls and routing changes.
