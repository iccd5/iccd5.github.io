00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.085
In this exercise, you're tasked with suggesting ways to detect and

00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:10.785
mitigate the attack tactics leveraged by hacker Holly against Mary.

00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:17.340
So with special attention to initiation and the execution phases of the attack framework.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.625
So we're looking at these two buckets here specifically.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:26.100
Now the attacker we know leveraged spear phishing for initiation and also

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.875
leveraged user execution to make the attack happen

00:00:28.875 --> 00:00:31.860
because in order for a spear phishing attack to work,

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.170
a user has to click on the e-mail.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.000
So that's how we know which boxes we need to use.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.435
From this attack framework,

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:41.475
you would start with initiation.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.800
If we know that it was a spear phishing attack,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.480
you'd go to spear phishing,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.960
it included a link that she had to log into

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.825
and so we can assume that that's a spear phishing link.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:53.210
If we click into this,

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.100
similar to what you saw in the lesson,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.225
you get a lot of rich information on what a spear phishing link is,

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:04.530
what procedures have been used by various attack groups in this case.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.910
If we keep scrolling down,

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.670
the question is around what our mitigation

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.720
tactics and detection techniques that can be used?

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.500
This is where you can find all of

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.610
that helpful information to pull together and answer for this solution.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.220
We know that you can restrict web-based content,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.715
you can use user training and so on to detect this.

00:01:23.715 --> 00:01:29.000
Then if we look at the execution side of things,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.300
we know that this required user intervention or user action.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.410
So this is where you'd be exploring all of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.470
the different attack tactics used here and you would

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.100
come to the conclusion based on knowing that it was user execution,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.910
that that's the box that you need to be looking at here.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.860
Once you click on "User Execution",

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.300
you get to the user execution page.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.805
Similarly, you see a lot of information.

00:01:52.805 --> 00:01:56.270
You can again go down to the bottom

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.480
here and learn what the mitigation and detection techniques are.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.680
So in this case, there are some technical things that you can do to

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.705
mitigate this around application whitelisting, network intrusion prevention.

00:02:08.705 --> 00:02:10.130
But then also again,

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.280
we've talked about throughout the course to this point that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.760
user error can be huge and insider threats are huge.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.290
So this user training is very important as well.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.650
Then you can see more on how to detect this type of tactic as well.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.620
So that's the solution for this exercise.
