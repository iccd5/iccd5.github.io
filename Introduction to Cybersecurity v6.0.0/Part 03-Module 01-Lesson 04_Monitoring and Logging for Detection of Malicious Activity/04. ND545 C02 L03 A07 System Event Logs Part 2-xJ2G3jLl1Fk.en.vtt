00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
Now we're moving on to Linux logs.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.045
Keep in mind, we're using CentOS version 7.x.

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:08.970
We'll review the primary location for logs,

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.490
we'll learn what types of logs are kept,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.880
we'll install audit that makes viewing logs easier.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.315
Then we'll view some sample events. Let's get started.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:24.360
The directory for logs can be found in /var/log.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.700
Once you've navigated to var/log,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.220
type "ls" to see the contents.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.740
Let's look at some of the logs in our CentOS lab server.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.935
The texts in white are log files,

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:39.615
directories are represented by blue text,

00:00:39.615 --> 00:00:44.215
and finally, an archive file is featured in red text.

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:48.825
As you recall, we used yum to view updates in lesson 2.

00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:51.725
You'll see the log file for yum listed here.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:55.220
Also important is the secure log file,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.120
this is where successful and failed login information is stored.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.045
More on that in just a moment.

00:01:01.045 --> 00:01:04.050
Lastly, you'll see the cron log file.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.980
cron is the application Linux uses to schedule tasks.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.060
As you can see, there are many others,

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.820
these are just a few key examples that are noteworthy.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.970
Let's install Audit to make viewing logs easier.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.865
To do so type "sudo",

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:21.564
which you'll recall grants us elevated privileges,

00:01:21.564 --> 00:01:24.585
"yum install audit" and hit "Enter",

00:01:24.585 --> 00:01:26.570
you'll be prompted for your password.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.425
We use audit to view successful and failed login attempts.

00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:35.150
To view successful logins type the command as shown in hit "Enter".

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.870
Your exact results will vary based on the logins attempted on your server,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.570
but the output should be similar.

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.450
To view failed logins,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.040
type this command as shown.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.220
Again, your data will vary,

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.220
but the output should look similar.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.580
Now that we've learned where our CentOS distro stores its logs,

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.795
and how to view them,

00:01:53.795 --> 00:01:55.925
what should we monitor an alert on?

00:01:55.925 --> 00:02:00.270
We should absolutely monitor an alert on failed login attempts,

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.745
this is patient zero when it comes to security.

00:02:02.745 --> 00:02:05.860
An adversary is attempting to log into your computer,

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.900
disabled and new cron jobs could be away for

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.130
an adversary to establish persistence and should be monitored.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.685
Remember, cron jobs are scheduled tasks,

00:02:14.685 --> 00:02:18.170
it is not uncommon for an adversary to use scheduled tasks

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.980
to re-establish a connection in the event their connection is lost.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:24.110
As we learned in a previous lesson,

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.465
there are edge cases where we do not want updates installed on specific servers,

00:02:28.465 --> 00:02:30.920
due to legacy or custom applications.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.585
We may want to alert on yum updates for those servers.

00:02:34.585 --> 00:02:38.945
Finally, most Linux servers are installed to support applications.

00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:41.270
There will likely be many logs that are subject to

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.035
monitoring and alerting in your organization.

00:02:44.035 --> 00:02:47.225
Unless you are dealing with a small amount of servers,

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:51.425
it is recommended that you enable log shipping on all of your devices,

00:02:51.425 --> 00:02:54.080
otherwise, you will spend most of your time

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:57.115
connecting and disconnecting from servers to view logs.

00:02:57.115 --> 00:03:00.200
This greatly increases the odds you'll miss something.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.895
By enabling log shipping,

00:03:01.895 --> 00:03:05.420
you can utilize centralized storage for all of your log files.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.900
This allows you to administer your environment more effectively,

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.710
as there is now one single location for all of your system logs.

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:17.705
Monitoring your devices will be considerably more streamlined with the logs in one place.

00:03:17.705 --> 00:03:21.005
By having all of your applicable system logs in one place,

00:03:21.005 --> 00:03:23.000
it eases compliance requirements.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.160
We'll cover more of this later in the lesson.
