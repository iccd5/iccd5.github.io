00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.785
Welcome to the next lesson.

00:00:01.785 --> 00:00:03.975
Now that we've learned about security principles

00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.270
and apply them to network and host security,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.680
we're ready to turn our attention to monitoring.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.790
This is a very important lesson.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.570
Monitoring your environment is one of

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.540
the most significant responsibilities of a security analyst.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.070
If you recall our three component model of security, prevent, detect,

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.050
and respond, this lesson will focus primarily on detection and response.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.500
We'll learn about system event logs,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.570
monitoring network traffic, and close it out with a look at SIEMs. Let's dig in.
