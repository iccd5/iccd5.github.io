00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
So far we've learned about Event Logs in monitoring traffic,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.555
will close it out with learning about SIEM.

00:00:06.555 --> 00:00:08.445
By the end of this section,

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.920
you will understand what a SIEM is,

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.490
understand why SIEM is important for your organization.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.770
Choose which SIEM is right for you,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.510
open source or commercial.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.400
Learn about the different ways logs are

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.720
ingested and finally learn the basics of querying a SIEM.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.215
Where does the SIEM fit in R3 component model of security?

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:31.680
All three, prevention, detection, and response.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.795
What is a SIEM?

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:38.115
It stands for Security Information and Event Management.

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:42.480
That means it's an application that serves as a log aggregator.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.890
What sets it apart from just being centralized log storage,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.900
are the logic and features involved?

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.145
These features analyze the data and make it queryable.

00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:53.085
Why is the SIEM important?

00:00:53.085 --> 00:00:57.260
Organizations utilize SIEMs to effectively analyze, monitor,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.210
and protect their most important data,

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.595
and establish proof that they are doing so,

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:04.600
which allows them to meet compliance requirements.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.435
By offloading them to your SIEM,

00:01:06.435 --> 00:01:08.925
you can look much farther back in time.

00:01:08.925 --> 00:01:10.590
How do you choose the SIEM?

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.735
There are many options to choose from.

00:01:12.735 --> 00:01:15.680
You have to factor in the size of your organization,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.505
whether there'll be a dedicated resource and of course, budgets.

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:22.405
Here's some considerations when choosing your solution.

00:01:22.405 --> 00:01:24.225
What is the licensing model?

00:01:24.225 --> 00:01:27.050
Is it storage based or volume of events?

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.495
Does it allow for unlimited sources?

00:01:29.495 --> 00:01:32.960
Scalability? If your organization grows rapidly,

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.060
does this solution grow gracefully?

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.014
Does the solution provide real time alerts?

00:01:38.014 --> 00:01:40.775
How complicated is the query a language?

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:43.795
Are there built-in customizable dashboards?

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:47.220
Should you choose an open-source SIEM such as ELK?

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.950
Being open source, these products will be highly customizable to your specific needs.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.030
There's generally a strong support community,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.895
most have a lack of restrictions on how much data is ingested.

00:01:58.895 --> 00:02:03.080
The biggest drawbacks to open source come in the form of support and

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.625
in the quality and quantity built-in features such as dashboards.

00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:11.690
There are quite a few commercial SIEMs such as logarithm,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.630
QRadar, chronicle, and splunk.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.150
The strengths of commercial SIEM are,

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.010
support part of your licensing fees includes access to the support team.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.190
While all SIEMs require extensive configuration,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.070
most commercial versions do a little more out of the box.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.200
A commercial SIEM will often come with

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.430
more applications and dashboards already installed.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.860
The primary drawback to commercial SIEMs is the price.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.465
If you have a large environment,

00:02:38.465 --> 00:02:40.550
they can be extremely expensive.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.915
Having said all that, many open-source SIEMs perform just as well as commercial.

00:02:44.915 --> 00:02:48.655
It is truly more about fitting your organization's needs.

00:02:48.655 --> 00:02:50.990
In any type of log aggregation,

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.120
whether it's Event Forwarding in Windows,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.565
syslog or a full SIEM application,

00:02:55.565 --> 00:02:57.065
the logs have to get there.

00:02:57.065 --> 00:02:59.720
What are the ways that log files travel?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.805
A push is where the source objects sends the files in real time to the destination.

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:09.320
A pull occurs when the destination request the logs in real time,

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:14.480
when the files are pushed or pulled all at once on a schedule would be in batch form.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.000
Many SIEMs operate using agents that are

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.900
installed on the source and keep the log synchronized.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.835
All SIEMs are different in their query structure.

00:03:22.835 --> 00:03:27.620
However, there are strategies that can be used to write better queries in any SIEM.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.470
Broad keyword searches use more resources

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.290
on the SIEM as well as take valuable time from you.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:35.525
The better you organize your query,

00:03:35.525 --> 00:03:38.480
the faster and more accurate your results will be.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.035
For example, if you know you're looking for Windows traffic,

00:03:42.035 --> 00:03:47.435
utilize your chosen SIEM's query language to identify Windows event logs as the source.

00:03:47.435 --> 00:03:50.525
By focusing your query on a single type of source,

00:03:50.525 --> 00:03:53.750
it will automatically exclude searching anywhere else.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.930
It's okay to allow for a greater range of time.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.225
But know that the tighter the timeframe,

00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:01.355
the fewer logs their artists search.

00:04:01.355 --> 00:04:04.520
If you know that the event happened in the last couple days,

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.985
don't select a search for the last 30.

00:04:06.985 --> 00:04:09.275
While it may take a bit more time,

00:04:09.275 --> 00:04:11.870
start with a slightly more general query.

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.305
For example, if you are troubleshooting an issue on your website,

00:04:15.305 --> 00:04:18.200
run the query against all of your web servers,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.290
and then work your way down to a specific machine.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:22.865
As with any new skill,

00:04:22.865 --> 00:04:24.485
it takes time to develop it.

00:04:24.485 --> 00:04:26.945
The more you work on it, the better you'll get.

00:04:26.945 --> 00:04:29.870
For example, this 24-hour search for

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.785
Google.com in my environment turned up nearly one million events.

00:04:33.785 --> 00:04:36.770
But if I know the event happened in last couple hours,

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.770
I can change the range to four hours and narrow it down

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.240
from nearly one million to just under 150,000.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.745
If I know that I'm looking for a specific DNS entries,

00:04:46.745 --> 00:04:51.665
I can change my source type from any to only querying DNS logs.

00:04:51.665 --> 00:04:57.215
I'm keeping the search at the last four hours and get just under 14,000 entries.

00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.230
As you can see, the more specific your search,

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.310
the faster it runs,

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.874
and the fewer results that you have to analyze.

00:05:03.874 --> 00:05:08.570
The power of a SIEM is that it allows you to search your entire environment,

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.225
alert on events your organization values,

00:05:11.225 --> 00:05:16.440
and retain logs as long as necessary and you can do this from one screen.
