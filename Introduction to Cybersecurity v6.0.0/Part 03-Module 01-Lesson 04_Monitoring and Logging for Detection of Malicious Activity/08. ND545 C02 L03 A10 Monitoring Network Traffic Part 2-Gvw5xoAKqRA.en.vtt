00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
Netstat is a powerful utility on both Windows and Linux.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.394
I encourage you to explore the various commands.

00:00:07.394 --> 00:00:15.300
We're going to view netstat -at and netstat -r here.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.060
Once you've connected to your CentOS server, type netstat -at.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.600
Your output may vary but will look similar to this.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.940
As you can see, there's not much going on,

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.070
but the output is similar in nature to what we saw

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.530
in Windows with local and foreign addresses.

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.235
Now let's try netstat -r here.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:38.385
This will show us our routing table for this machine.

00:00:38.385 --> 00:00:42.860
This would be valuable if we were troubleshooting connection issues to another device.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.825
As you will recall from Lesson 2,

00:00:44.825 --> 00:00:47.180
we set up firewall and IDS rules.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.405
Now let's see what happens when those type of alerts fire.

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:53.350
Then we'll learn what mitigation steps we can take.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.145
Here you see a modified version of a real report I review daily.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:01.610
Across the top, you see all of the relevant categories.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.800
I have selected WordPress attacks,

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.855
but there are many others to choose from.

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:11.270
The primary attacks we see are the brute force login attacks and a vulnerability attack.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.760
A brute force attack is where the attacker

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.805
throws as many passwords as possible at a target.

00:01:16.805 --> 00:01:21.485
A vulnerability attack is where there's a known vulnerability with a piece of software.

00:01:21.485 --> 00:01:24.230
You see the source and destination IPs.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.565
I've hidden parts of the sources and modified the destinations for privacy purposes.

00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:31.595
What steps can we take to mitigate this threat?

00:01:31.595 --> 00:01:33.905
We researched the IPs involved.

00:01:33.905 --> 00:01:36.715
Is this source a friend or foe?

00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:38.585
Is it on any block lists?

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:41.915
Does our IP even host WordPress or vBulletin.

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:47.690
To research an IP, you can visit abuseipdb.com.

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.030
Keep in mind, this is community-driven,

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.425
but it can yield trends such as an IP being reported hundreds of times.

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:57.710
Also, VirusTotal is an excellent resource,

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.020
it can provide whether an IP,

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.860
URL or FAO is malicious or clean.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.570
If you find the traffic is indeed malicious,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.210
you can file a complaint with the ISP hosting it.

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:10.729
To report an IP to an ISP,

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.800
you can search the "who is" information,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.785
and by law, the contact for abuse must be present.

00:02:15.785 --> 00:02:20.240
You can add the IP to your manual block list we'd learned about in Lesson 2.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.100
You'll also need to verify that

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.685
your WordPress and vBulletin installations are fully patched.

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:29.200
Here we have real alerts from a Snort IDS.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.435
Across the top you see the number of alerts,

00:02:32.435 --> 00:02:36.345
IPs involved, and what signature fired.

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:38.370
How do we mitigate these alerts?

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.640
In much the same way as the firewall report,

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.240
we look up each signature and verify it applies to our IP.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.615
We also verify if the external IP is friend or foe.

00:02:47.615 --> 00:02:50.165
If you find the traffic is indeed malicious,

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:52.720
you can file a complaint with the ISP hosting it.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.440
Again, you can add the IP to your manual blocklist we learned about in Lesson 2.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.570
If the vulnerability was correct,

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.400
you will need to update the software involved.
