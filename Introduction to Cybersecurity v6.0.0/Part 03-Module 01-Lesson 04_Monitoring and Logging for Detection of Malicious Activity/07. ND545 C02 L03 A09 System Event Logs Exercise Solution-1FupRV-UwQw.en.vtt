00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
You were tasked with using PowerShell to

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.640
retrieve the most 50 recent entries from the system log,

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.080
let's see how you did.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.170
Your output will likely differ in details,

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.180
but should look something similar to this.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.295
Let's see what's going on with this machine.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:18.480
As you can see, there are several services stopping and starting automatically,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.970
and Windows updates were successfully installed.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.610
Even though this machine seems relatively happy,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.474
this is where you would see errors such as failed services

00:00:26.474 --> 00:00:30.440
and full disks we learned about in the lesson. Great job.
