00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
When is an alert not an alert?

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.220
Earlier, we reviewed a Firewall Threat Report on SSH traffic.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.860
SSH is a favorite target of

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.015
adversaries as it is easy to script an automated brute force attack.

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:19.155
However, it is not uncommon for these alerts to be a false positive.

00:00:19.155 --> 00:00:22.875
This is where the intuition we've been working on comes into play.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:25.815
The more you know your environment and work these alerts,

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:27.060
you'll know that many times,

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.940
these alerts come from a script that has a misconfiguration,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.730
such as a typo in the username or password,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.270
or possibly your management has ordered a penetration test.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.515
If that's the case,

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:39.060
when you look up the source IP,

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.160
you'll see that it's a valid pen test vendor.
