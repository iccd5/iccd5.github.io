00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.070
You were tasked with explaining why an organization that is PCI compliant and has

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.990
multiple locations with over 1,000

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.425
employees and hundreds of servers would benefit from running a SIEM.

00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:12.830
Let's see how you did. Here are

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.745
several items to consider when making the case to implement a SIEM.

00:00:16.745 --> 00:00:20.260
A SIEM is centralized log aggregation repository.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.850
All the logs across the entire organization will be available in one spot.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.795
It will meet your PCI compliance requirements.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:29.550
Beyond just storing the logs,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.290
the SIEM applies logic that enhances the data,

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.140
saving time when researching security and performance events.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.445
The real-time monitoring can alert for potentially malicious events.

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:42.770
You can retain the data for much longer with

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.470
the SIEM than are in most networking equipment and servers.
