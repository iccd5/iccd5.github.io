To understand the approach, we will learn about what a compliance obligation is, how your organization works with obligations, and how to evaluate obligations for your organization.  Additionally, we will demonstrate how to assess existing security controls against compliance obligations to ensure your organization’s compliance.\n",

              "text": "One of the biggest misconceptions about compliance is that it is related to the law.  There are probably a couple of reasons as to why.  First, if you’ll recall, we talked about how compliance is intended to prove the organization is acting in a trustworthy or expected manner.  Second, there are a large number of laws and regulations that do create compliance obligations for companies working in certain industries, but not every compliance obligation is related to a legal obligation.  We will discuss that as we progress throughout this lesson.\nIn the Security GRC profession, however, all our security obligations do affect operational security controls --- meaning that security compliance obligations are met with specific security controls.  In this way, the practice of Security GRC is mostly binary.  Either you comply with an obligation, or you don’t, although there are a few caveats. \n\nBefore we talk more about Security Compliance, it is important to have a basic understanding of how the practice has evolved into what we think of as Security Compliance today.  If you’ll recall, earlier in this course, I talked about fraud and business failure combining to create oversight and regulation that led to the beginnings of modern-day traditional GRC practices.  At the same time, there were two other forces combining to give rise to Security GRC.  First, companies were at the very beginning of a technological watershed beginning their journeys to the cloud and intertwining technology with most business processes (digital transformation).  Second, the reliance on technology required greater security controls to ensure operations, avoid breaches, and avoid fraud.  Keeping in mind that security is built to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of systems and data, the more technology gained a foothold in business, the more security was needed to protect it. \n\nKnowing that fraud and business failure led to regulation in the early 2000s and that technology was beginning to be inseparable from business processes, let’s look back at the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  We know that Sarbanes-Oxley was passed in direct response to the Enron scandal and other business failures like it, and if you examine Section 302 of the act, you can clearly see the desire to hold individuals accountable for rampant fraud.  Section 302 mandates that senior corporate officers in publicly traded companies personally certify the accuracy of the organization’s financial statements.  If we then examine Section 404, we see that the act requires the establishment of internal controls and reporting to measure the adequacy of the controls.  In this case, the controls are really any controls that help the organization maintain accurate financial statements, but in many cases, those controls are technological in nature.  As we said before, in order to ensure that technology is operating efficiently, we need to secure the technology through security controls.  So today, Section 404 operates to require assessments of technology and security mechanisms that support financial statements. \n\nThis doesn’t just affect the financial services market or publicly traded companies.  Other vertical industries have also worked to create regulations, laws, or standards that require strong security controls in order to protect individuals.  Today, you can see even further expansion of these ideas in consumer privacy-related regulations.  While these laws are designed to protect privacy, a part of that equation is securing personal data.\n",

              "text": "Let’s begin this lesson with an oversimplified definition of compliance.  Compliance, or being compliant, means that you are meeting your obligations.  If you want to attend a football game, you must have a ticket.  If you have that ticket, you comply and can enter. \n\nWhat do we mean by obligations, though?  There are what some GRC professionals might describe as big or capital letter OBLIGATIONS and what they might describe as little or lowercase obligations.  Typically, they mean that there is a top-level source document (OBLIGATION) and lower-level objectives (obligations) within the source document.  The top-level source documents are standards, regulations, laws, and etc. While the lower level objectives are the individual control statements contained in the top-level document. \nTo help make this clear, we will use the term Obligation to mean the top-level source documents and Control Objectives to mean the specific controls that the Obligation wishes to enforce.  PCI-DSS, HIPAA, FedRAMP, and others are Obligations.  Controls such as you must maintain an 8-character password, are Control Objectives.\n\nFinally, we said earlier that compliance is mostly binary, but that isn’t always the case.  Compliance in the strictest sense means that your organization has met each Control Objective to the letter, and many Obligations require organizations to have an independent 3rd party assess the organization’s controls to ensure compliance.  In these cases, the 3rd party assessor certifies that the organization is in compliance.  Other Obligations, however, allow organizations to self-certify --- meaning that the organization agrees it has met the Control Objectives of an Obligation or the spirit of each objective.  This brings us to exceptions.  There are certain instances when an organization can be compliant yet not meet every Control Objective.  You may, for instance, have met most objectives but failed to fully meet a handful of objectives to the letter, or you have certain compensating controls in place that generally create the same level of protection as Control Objective demands.  In any case, your organization will likely want to consult with an independent assessor about exceptions and compensating controls prior to claiming certification.",

              "text": "What are the benefits of compliance?  In many cases, organizations must comply with certain Obligations because of a business activity they already perform or because of an industry they operate within, but not all compliance Obligations are mandatory.  Sometimes businesses use compliance to make themselves more attractive to potential customers --- adopting a standard to demonstrate a minimal level of security.\n\nOrganizations can form a nexus to an Obligation in one of three ways.  First, the company may be required to meet an obligation based on existing business activity.  For instance, a company would be required to be HIPAA compliant if it stored, processed, or transmitted US healthcare information.  Next, companies can contractually obligate themselves to Obligations.  They may do this by either contracting with a customer or business partners to meet Control Objectives specifically spelled out within the contract, there may be additional security requirements attached to the contract in a rider (a separate document that acts as part of a contract), or the contract may dictate that the organization comply with a well-known Obligation like PCI-DSS or ISO27001.  Finally, organizations may choose to comply with any number of Obligations by adopting the Obligation and working toward complying with its Control Objectives.\n\nCircling back to non-contractual Obligations, we briefly mentioned certain Obligations that companies are required to follow if engaged in specific business activity.  These are standards or laws like PCI-DSS which is a standard required by any organization that processes credit card data, HIPAA which is a law required by any organization that stores, processes, or transmits healthcare data, or GDPR which is a privacy regulation required by any organization that stores, processes, or transmits personally identifiable information of European Union citizens. \n\nThere are, however, other standards like ISO27001 or SOCII that are not specifically required by any business activity or industry.  Rather, these are security standards intended to be adopted by companies to prove that they possess some minimum level of security. \n",

              "text": "Once Compliance professionals understand their organization’s Obligations and the resultant Control Objectives, they must measure existing security controls against Control Objectives in order to determine compliance.  Assessment operates similarly to what we discussed in the Governance lesson meaning that existing security controls are measured against Control Objectives in function and in time.  As an example, if a Control Objective requires that firewall logs are checked daily, the organization’s security control should ensure that a) firewall logs are checked (this is the function) and b) they are checked daily (this is the time).  What is important here is that the Compliance professional takes caution to fully understand the needs of the Control Objective and the existing function of certain security controls.\n\nIn some instances, an organization’s controls may meet the needs of more than one Control Objective.  For instance, one Obligation may have a Control Objective that expects your organization to continuously monitor firewall rules for unauthorized changes.  A second Obligation may have a Control Objective that expects your organization to audit changes at least 1 time per week for unauthorized changes.  If your organization has a firewall control in which the security team is alerted every time any firewall change is made, it meets the requirements of both Control Objectives.\n\nFinally, there can also be what are described as compensating controls.  Compensating controls are controls that may not meet the letter of a Compliance Objective but may meet it in spirit.  For instance, if a Control Objective demands that employees of your organization are not allowed to access the Internet for fear of unauthorized data loss and your organization does allow Internet access, you don’t meet the Control Objective.  However, you may have other controls such as data loss prevention mechanisms and web-filtering software in place that help prevent data loss.  These controls may compensate for not meeting the Control Objective.  These situations, however, typically require an independent 3rd party opinion as to whether the controls effectively compensate.\n",

That standard has a control objective related to password management that states \"All network user accounts must contain passwords that are at least 12 characters in length, are complex, and expire after 120 days\".  You have asked your system administrators if the organization meets this objective and the system administrators have told you that the \"User directory service which allows employees to log into the network is configured for 12 character, complex passwords which expire after 90 days\".  Does this control meet the objective?  Why or why not?"

If \"network user accounts\" means employee accounts then it appears your controls do meet the objective.  If \"network user accounts\" means any user account that exists on the network, you must seek additional information about the construction of passwords related to items like service accounts and infrastructure accounts for items like firewalls, routers, and etc. ",
