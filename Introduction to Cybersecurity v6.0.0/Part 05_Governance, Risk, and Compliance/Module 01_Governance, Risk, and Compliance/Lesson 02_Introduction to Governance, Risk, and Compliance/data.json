              "text": "This lesson begins by demonstrating how core governance, risk, and compliance (GRC) concepts support the ideals of how a successful business might run.  For instance, businesses likely want to be:\n\n- Mission Oriented - focused on a particular task or overall goal\n- Shrewd – Well-positioned to take advantage of market opportunities and wise enough to avoid mistakes\n- Trustworthy – Viewed with trust by customers and business partners\n\nBusinesses use traditional GRC concepts to support those goals. \n\n- Governance – keeping the business mission oriented\n- Risk management – keeping the business from making mistakes while taking advantage of opportunity\n- Compliance – Meeting obligations to act in certain ways\n\nSecurity GRC, however, is less focused on business outcomes and more focused on the security outcomes that support overarching business goals.  For instance, Security Governance is still targeted at keeping an organization mission oriented but mission oriented as it relates to implementing appropriate security controls.  Security Risk Management continues to be focused on managing risk but is aimed at managing security-related risk as opposed to managing organizational or financial risk.  Finally, Security Compliance ensures that organizations are living up to their security obligations.  Certainly, all of the Security GRC functions support the business, but they operate at a more tactical level.\n\nThroughout the course, we’ll examine each of the three components of Security GRC --- Governance, Risk, and Compliance.  We’ll additionally spend time talking about a fourth critical function of GRC---Audit Management.\n\n",

              "text": "Governance, Risk, and Compliance is often used as an umbrella term for activities within an organization that operate to support business operations and goals as they related to governing specific activities, managing risk, and complying with different types of business obligations.  While that umbrella term is broader than the specific Security GRC components that are focused on throughout this course, it's important to understand how overall GRC has taken shape.\n\nWhile businesses have long since been attempting to operate with specific goals in mind, GRC, as a practice, has taken shape over the past 30 years or so.  Two major factors in the rise of GRC relate to fraud and business failure occurring near the turn of the century. \n\nFraud and business failure as drivers to GRC make a great deal of sense.  If you look back over history, major events have driven regulatory response in some way.  The failures of the Great Depression led to the formation of both the Security Exchange Committee and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) in an attempt to keep individuals’ financial assets safe from poorly managed market and investment activities.  There are other examples as well, like the 1864 formation of the Office of the Comptroller of Currency, which slightly preceded the end of the Civil War and ended what was known as the Free Banking Era --- a period of loosely constructed bank regulations.\n\nIf you fast-forward to the late 1990s and early 2000s we start to see significant corporate fraud and failure with the dotcom bubble bursting, all culminating with the bankruptcy of Enron.  Enron was an American energy commodity and service company who filed bankruptcy on December 3, 2001, after it was revealed that their financial statements and outlook were the result of systemic corporate fraud.  These events led directly to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in 2002, which held executives at publicly traded companies liable for the accuracy of financial statements. \n\nAt the same time, there are schools of thought starting to develop around how organizations should be managed in order to protect their employees, shareholders, and the public.  The OCEG or Open Compliance and Ethics Group was one of the leaders in developing a systematic approach to ensuring that organizations were running responsibly and in 2002 they developed a GRC operating model which defined GRC as “the integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty and act with integrity.”  The idea being that the business process can be managed in such a way that we are able to ensure the business is operating in a manner consistent with some of the goals we defined earlier:\n\n- Mission Oriented\n- Shrewd\n- Trustworthy\n\nThe only challenge as it relates to Security GRC is that business processes and Security / Cybersecurity processes aren’t necessarily managed in the same way.  It's difficult to think about applying the same process used to audit financial statements to those used to audit the effectiveness of a security control or equating customer retention activities to managing vulnerabilities.  As a result, we have traditionally thought about GRC in two ways:  \n\n1. Operational \n2. IT --- with Security GRC being a large part of IT GRC. \n\nThere is one caveat, however, in more modern GRC implementations, folks do talk about how IT infrastructure has become such an embedded part of business processes that it's nearly impossible to separate business from IT operations.  Think about certain business risks, for instance.  Many of them may be tied to technology failure.  Carrying that forward, we also talk about how security is impossible to separate from IT Operations because of the reliance on security mechanisms to ensure that our IT infrastructure is operating effectively.  So, there is a school of thought that the term GRC can now be broadly applied to both business or operational GRC and IT GRC.  Throughout the rest of this course, however, we’ll treat the two separately and focus on IT GRC and specifically on the security components contained within it.\n",

If you’ll recall, we previously discussed the OCEG’s definition of GRC, and I think it’s a great starting point for defining Security GRC. \n \nAs a reminder, the OCEG definition was: “the integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives, address uncertainty and act with integrity,” but also remember that Security GRC is more narrowly focused on supporting the Security mission.  If we combine the OCEG definition with the more tactical outcomes of Security, than we end up with something more along the lines of the following:\n\nSecurity GRC is the integrated collection of capabilities that enable an organization to set and meet strategic goals, address existing and emerging threats, and meet obligations as they relate to security.\n\nAll these functions (Governance, Risk, and Compliance), of course, coming together at the intersection of Security Controls, meaning that each of the three functions operates to ensure security controls are operating in a way that supports business outcomes. When Security GRC functions and ultimately, security controls are not functioning as anticipated, the results could mean security gaps throughout the infrastructure.  If, for instance, you look at any of the high-profile security breaches frequently reported in the news, you can typically find links between GRC and security failures and the severity of the incident.\n\nIf you examined breaches like those from Booz Allen Hamilton or the Office of Personnel Management, for instance, you would likely find multiple security failures and many opportunities to improved security posture through healthy Security GRC practices before the breach occurred or that would have led to less severe results.\n\n- [Booz Allen Hamilton 2017 Breach](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/05/defense-contractor-stored-intelligence-data-in-amazon-cloud-unprotected/)\n- [OPM Breach](https://www.opm.gov/cybersecurity/cybersecurity-incidents/)\n\n",

The way security professionals accomplish that goal is by implementing various security controls, and typically, those security controls can be categorized in 1 of 3 ways:  \n\n1. Detective\n2. Preventive\n3. Reactive.\n\n- Preventive controls are those designed to stop malicious behavior in its tracks--- prevent it from occurring.  These are firewalls, web-application firewalls, anti-virus solutions, and etc.\n\n- Detective controls are designed to detect malicious behavior allowing security professionals to respond in some way.  These are controls like network or host-based intrusion detection systems or user behavior analytics platforms.\n\n- Reactive controls are designed to enable security personnel to react to potential security events once detected.\n\nOccasionally security professionals will describe what are called policy controls meaning controls that are policy or procedure-based and not technological controls, but we will talk about policy and procedure as if they are a part of preventive controls.  Policies and procedures are designed to prevent security issues.\n",

              "text": "GRC roles don’t necessarily function independently.  Much like we described in our Introduction to GRC, the roles are intended to function together to provide holistic oversight for operational security.  When one role operates independently, and without considering other roles, it can create confusion for peers and employees. \n\nFor instance, the ability for users to bring their own devices (cellphones) to work --- meaning they can use the devices for certain work functions.  Imagine that your organization’s users have always been able to use their cell phones, and suddenly, a new policy is announced forbidding the continued use of employee-owned devices.\n\nPerhaps the policy was created by a Governance professional, but Risk and Compliance team members were not informed of the change. This would likely create a good deal of confusion.  Often, policy changes that impact a significant part of the organization’s user population are discussed thoroughly and are precipitated by a risk management event or new compliance initiative.  Therefore, it's important that the roles work together to make sure the GRC function operates smoothly.\n\nThis is also a good time to mention GRC software.  We won’t really be covering GRC software in this course, but it's good to know that it exists, and its purpose is to provide a central repository for gathering GRC related information.  GRC software can:\n- Help keep track of compliance obligations\n- Act as a central repository for audit, compliance, and governance issues that require remediation\n- Act as a central repository for risk and exception management decisions\n- And more\n\nFor software to be effective, however, most organizations should ensure that their GRC processes are mature and operating well.  Otherwise, software can go unused, create conflict between GRC functions, and unnecessarily cut into the security budget.\n",

That includes the security controls.\n\nThis will be a recurring theme throughout the course.  Security and Security GRC professionals serve to support business objectives, and it's vital that GRC professionals understand business objectives and can communicate effectively with stakeholders throughout the organization.\n",

                "text": "Your organization, SwiftTech, recently underwent a security audit. During the audit, the assessor noted 4 findings that you need to address in your capacity as a GRC analyst outlined below:\n\n- One of the findings is a critical vulnerability in a web application. It will likely be difficult to fix immediately.\n\n- A separate finding is a high vulnerability in the web server that supports the same web application with the critical vulnerability. It will likely be relatively easy to fix.\n\n- Related to the same application, there are two medium vulnerabilities in the database that supports the application. They will be moderately difficult to fix.\n\n- Finally, there is a low level vulnerability related to credential management throughout the organization. It will be moderately difficult to fix.\n\nThe web application and the supporting infrastructure is scheduled to be decommissioned in the next 12 months. Knowing this, how would you prioritize fixing the vulnerabilities above? Why? Write a paragraph below outlining which items would be most important. "

              "answer": {
                "text": "There is probably no one \"right\" answer to this question.  Your answer will likely depend on your organization's tolerance for risk and any policies that you might have defining when a vulnerability must be fixed.  These types of policies are also dependent on your organization's risk tolerance (also known as risk posture).\n\nIf your organization, for instance, is somewhat risk averse (meaning you want to reduce risk as much as possible) you may choose to remediate every one of the flaws or choose to fix the critical and high vulnerabilities leaving the medium and low level vulnerabilities alone because the application is scheduled to be decommissioned relatively soon.  This is probably the path that I would take.  I'd likely choose to remediate the critical vulnerability because the application is scheduled to be decommissioned in a year.  If the application was going to be decommissioned in 3 months, it might change my mind but a year is a long time to live with a critical web application vulnerability even if it will likely be difficult to fix.  Fixing the high vulnerabilities that are easy to fix is a no-brainer.  Fixing the medium and low vulnerabilities will likely come down to a discussion about just how much effort it will take to fix them vs. exactly how bad the vulnerabilities are.  \n\nIn any case, if you choose to accept the risk of any vulnerability due to an application being decommissioned, you will likely need to create a management exception detailing exactly why the risk did not rise to the level that it needed to be fixed in accordance with your organization's typically vulnerability remediation schedule.
