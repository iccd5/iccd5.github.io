That experience taught me the value of GRC.\n\nAt the beginning of my career, I was very fortunate in that it coincided with so many important regulatory events that I was forced to understand the relationship between IT and outside influences like regulation and risk management.\n\nIn fact, I became so focused on harmonizing IT relationships that I helped create an IT audit firm. I also pursued some higher educational opportunities and became an attorney admitted to practice in the state of Maryland. I  also have a master's degree in Telecommunications. All of this was done in the pursuit of assisting organizations in developing mature cybersecurity and GRC practices.",

In Audit Management, we will discuss how audits originate and what GRC professionals must accomplish to ensure audits go smoothly.",

That doesn’t mean that every breach is the result of a failure.  In some cases, breaches occur even though organizations made perfectly reasoned risk management decisions, installed controls correctly, and governed their controls effectively.  In some cases, the smallest risk ends up being the cause of a breach, but these cases seem to be few and far between.  In most cases, control failure and multiple opportunities to remediate the failure cause breaches and make them more extensive than necessary.\n\nTake, for example, three of the most publicized breaches of all time (Target, Equifax, and the Office of Personnel Management).  That was the case with each of these breaches.  Control failures occurred, but opportunities along the way for GRC professionals to remediate those failures were missed.\n\n- [Target](https://www.forbes.com/sites/maggiemcgrath/2014/01/10/target-data-breach-spilled-info-on-as-many-as-70-million-customers/#33beb1a5e795) \n- [Equifax](https://www.csoonline.com/article/3444488/equifax-data-breach-faq-what-happened-who-was-affected-what-was-the-impact.html) \n- [Office of Personnel Management or OPM](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/inside-cyberattack-shocked-us-government/) \n\nThese are great examples of why Security GRC is so important.  GRC can help identify issues before they become breaches or work to minimize the overall impact of a breach.\n",

IT Operations, Security Operations, and Security GRC professionals all work to help the business accomplish that mission. A critical objective for the Security GRC professional is understanding how their tasks fit into the overall strategy. As a result, GRC professionals must develop communication and collaboration skills that help them work alongside business partners, identify opportunities to improve security posture and support business objectives.\n\nIn the past, security professionals were saddled with the reputation of playing a binary role in business processes --- making decisions about whether something is or is not secure. Today’s security professionals are really expected to help businesses find solutions that remain secure but help drive business goals forward.\n",

In fact, they may have been hired following a significant security event or in anticipation of a rapidly approaching assessment or business deadline.  In this project, that’s exactly the situation you’ll face.  You’ll walk into a growing company needing to react fast to solve some immediate GRC challenges. Among others, you’ll need to address policy issues and assist the organization in understanding what compliance obligations they should investigate to support expanding their successful business.",
