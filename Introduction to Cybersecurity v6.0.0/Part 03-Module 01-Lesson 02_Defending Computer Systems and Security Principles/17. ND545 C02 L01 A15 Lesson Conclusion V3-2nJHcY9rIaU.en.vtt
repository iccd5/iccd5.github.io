00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
In this lesson, we learned about using defense and

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.015
depth to create a layered defensive strategy.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.610
We also introduced the three components of

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.910
security that will be used frequently in subsequent lessons.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.270
They are, prevent, detect, and respond.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:19.485
We also learned about the wealth of security standards offered by NIST,

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.870
and specifically NIST 800.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.280
We close this lesson out with an introduction to the principle of least privilege.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.760
This specifically is something we will revisit throughout the course.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.610
In lesson 2, we'll take these principles and

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.250
apply them to network and host based security.
