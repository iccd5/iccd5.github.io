00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
We're moving to a core principle in defending

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.370
computer systems in really security in general,

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.770
and that's the principle of least privilege.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.065
We'll learn more about the concept as well as how to apply it in your organization.

00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:14.835
To start things off,

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:17.535
we'll define the principle of least privilege,

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:19.920
understand what it applies to,

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.635
then we'll break down a common scenario.

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:25.365
Where does the principle of least privilege fit

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.780
within our three component model of security?

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.640
It fits in prevention.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.515
What is the principle of least privilege and who or what does it apply to?

00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:38.455
The principle of least privilege in theory is actually quite simple.

00:00:38.455 --> 00:00:42.980
Grant the lowest level of access that is required to accomplish the task.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.380
This contributes to our defense and depth,

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.500
by removing unnecessary access when possible.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.540
This applies to people in a form of physical computer and data access.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.460
It applies to devices.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.630
Remember, that computer accounts have permissions as well.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.770
Network traffic, both external and internal needs to be routed

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.225
properly and have the correct access controls to minimize the attack surface.

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:12.230
Database permissions should be audited frequently to ensure that

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.400
the tables and records have the minimum level of access required.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.700
Many applications have permissions on the hosting server,

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.844
as well as the aforementioned databases.

00:01:21.844 --> 00:01:24.320
Be sure to review documentation and only

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.580
allow the minimum level of access needed to run properly.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.610
Here, we have a typical departmental directory accounting.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.925
Most accounting departments have at least two groups,

00:01:34.925 --> 00:01:38.120
accounts payable and accounts receivable.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.160
Lynn works in accounting,

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.115
but their primary role is in accounts payable.

00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:48.080
However, they also need access to view documents in the accounts receivable folder.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.540
The principle of least privilege applied here would

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.030
give Lynn read and write access to the accounts

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.920
payable folder while giving them read-only access to the accounts receivable folder.
