00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
You were tasked with using what you've learned here,

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.790
as well as your own research to identify areas where

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.260
an IT department could perform

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.395
its duties while implementing the principle of least privilege.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.720
Let's see how you did. Here are

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.230
two suggestions that could be implemented separately or combined.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.080
There are privileged management applications such as CyberArk,

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.915
that allow the checking out of administrator or root level accounts and passwords.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:30.210
Effectively, they generate a one-time password that will be used for that single event.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.110
The IT department can configure two different user accounts.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.110
For a vast majority of their day,

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.440
they'll be using their user-level account.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.075
When an administrator or root account is needed,

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:44.255
they'll login with their privilege account just for that task.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:46.520
For example, Jane Smith can have

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.750
a normal jsmith account with an administrator account of!jsmith,

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.790
also known as bang jsmith
