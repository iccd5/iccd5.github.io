00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Cybersecurity is not a monolith.

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.280
There is no one size fits all approach that you

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:08.010
can forklift into your organization and call it a day.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.240
It is a multidimensional field that should be treated like a living thing.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.020
The challenges change daily and you have to stay on your toes.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.120
The adversary certainly does.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.425
Having said all that,

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:21.390
there are some fundamentals that are in place.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.665
If you get those right,

00:00:22.665 --> 00:00:24.135
you'll be well on your way.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:29.369
With Defense in Depth will learn that in order to secure our organization systems,

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.250
we'll need several components as opposed to one.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.075
You may have heard that cybersecurity is a layered approach.

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:37.800
There are many different takes,

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.885
but for this course we're going with three components.

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:44.060
Prevention, detection, and response.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:46.600
We'll reference these throughout the course.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.105
First up is Defense in Depth.

00:00:49.105 --> 00:00:50.945
By the end of this section,

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:53.855
you will understand what Defense in Depth is,

00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:56.915
be able to explain the different components,

00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:00.200
and apply what you've learned to your own organization.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.595
Where does Defense in Depth fit in our three component model of security?

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:09.465
It has all three: prevention, detection, and response.

00:01:09.465 --> 00:01:12.960
So what exactly is Defense in Depth?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.835
Defense in Depth is adapted from military lingo.

00:01:16.835 --> 00:01:18.890
It refers to putting multiple,

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.560
and diverse types of obstacles in front of the enemy,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.955
to require additional use of their resources and effort.

00:01:24.955 --> 00:01:27.304
By adding complimentary defenses,

00:01:27.304 --> 00:01:31.040
the weakness of one defense is covered by the strength of another.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.025
Similarly, if one defense fails completely,

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:37.375
another's right behind it, thus minimizing risk.

00:01:37.375 --> 00:01:42.185
For this course, we're going to focus on the following components of Defense in Depth.

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:46.565
Security policies and procedures appear throughout the course.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:50.200
These along with the principles you'll learn in this lesson.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.015
Will provide the blueprint to guide the implementation of your security program.

00:01:55.015 --> 00:02:00.185
We'll learn about firewalls and other network protection devices in later lessons.

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.605
Monitoring is a key component in security.

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:05.959
If you aren't watching alerts,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.885
performance metrics, and other indicators.

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:12.005
How can you tell how effective your defenses are?

00:02:12.005 --> 00:02:14.230
Aside from personnel and data.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.585
The most interior layer of security is host security.

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:21.845
We'll look at several methods for securing the servers in your organization.

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:27.365
As you will see, the goal is to defend the data that your organization values.

00:02:27.365 --> 00:02:29.270
Whether that's customer data,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.555
intellectual property, or various patterns.

00:02:32.555 --> 00:02:36.560
From there, we add layer upon layer of defenses.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.570
This is a high level visual,

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.100
but as you'll see later,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.430
each layer has potential multiple sub-layers.
