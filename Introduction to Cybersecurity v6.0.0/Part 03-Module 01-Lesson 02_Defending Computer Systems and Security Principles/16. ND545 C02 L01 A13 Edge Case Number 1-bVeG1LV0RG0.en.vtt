00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.250
There will be times when the principle of

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.475
least privilege cannot be followed as closely as we would like.

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:08.520
I have often encountered applications that will not work

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.120
properly without running on the machine as an administrator or root.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.520
You can create a specific account for

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.415
this application and grant it the permissions it requires,

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:20.115
while limiting the account to just that machine.

00:00:20.115 --> 00:00:21.900
As you gain experience,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.180
you'll see the resolution to edge cases has

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.120
a certain familiarity to it in the form of monitoring.

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.585
Gather as many real-time logs as possible from this machine,

00:00:30.585 --> 00:00:33.075
and set alerts for suspicious behavior.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:36.660
Finally, you can isolate the machine the application

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.380
resides on as much as possible to limit the surface attack area.
