00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
Intuition lies at the intersection of knowledge and experience.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.255
The more you have of each,

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:08.100
the more intuition you develop.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.645
By taking this course,

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:11.520
you are well on your way to developing

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.430
the intuition needed for a career in cybersecurity.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.715
For instance, you work in an organization

00:00:17.715 --> 00:00:21.105
that is regularly audited for multiple compliances.

00:00:21.105 --> 00:00:25.810
You have been tasked with installing a new collaboration application,

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.460
and the documentation calls for the account that

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.750
connects to the database to have sys admin privileges.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.704
Due to your knowledge of layered security,

00:00:34.704 --> 00:00:37.640
and your experience of going through compliance audits,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.720
you will instantly know this violates the principle of lease privilege,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.465
opens a gaping hole in your database security,

00:00:44.465 --> 00:00:49.350
which could result in a data breach and will no doubt be caught by the auditor.
