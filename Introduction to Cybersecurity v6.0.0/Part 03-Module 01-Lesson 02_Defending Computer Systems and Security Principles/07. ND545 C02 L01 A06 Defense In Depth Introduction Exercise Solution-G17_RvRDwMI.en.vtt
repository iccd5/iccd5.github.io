00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
You are tasked with providing four examples of

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.925
key defense in depth security points for an organization.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:11.460
It has one headquarters location that contains all of the on-premises server hardware,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.800
three branch offices that connect to

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.385
the headquarters facility for email and other applications,

00:00:17.385 --> 00:00:23.820
a minimal cloud infrastructure that is contacted by customers as well as employees,

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.340
a workforce with laptops,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.415
workstations, and a mix of Windows and Mac.

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:31.050
Let's see how you did.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.600
Here are six examples, let's go through them.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.315
The headquarters location would need a larger,

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:41.125
more powerful firewall to handle the additional traffic from the branch offices.

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.645
If the primary infrastructure is located at the headquarters,

00:00:44.645 --> 00:00:47.990
controlled access to the server room is a necessity.

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.665
The server infrastructure, both on-prem and cloud,

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:55.960
will require proper permissions given their purpose and operating system.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.520
The workforce is using laptops,

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:00.200
which implies several things,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.775
encryption of the hard disk,

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:06.280
VPN access, and perhaps a cloud-based antivirus are needed.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.455
The branch offices will utilize a firewall and likely secured wireless.

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:17.675
An audit of the cloud infrastructure to ensure no public access exist must be completed.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:20.170
It's fine if you didn't come up with the same list.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.010
There are many options to choose from.
