00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
For this exercise, you are asked to review

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:09.510
the NIST 800-41 revision 1 standard and provide five key considerations.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.960
Let's see how you did. Here are several considerations I

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.365
came up with, stateful versus stateless.

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:21.480
A stateful firewall provides additional protection as opposed to a stateless firewall.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.400
If possible, purchase a firewall that contains deep packet inspection.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.240
This will allow the traffic to be analyzed deeper than simply ports.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.120
If also using a firewall as a VPN,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.680
a firewall with NAC,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.275
that's Network Access Control can inspect

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:40.620
incoming traffic for things such as updated anti-virus,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.950
time since last scan, and other configurations.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.690
UTM, Unified Threat Management is where

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.905
the firewall can dynamically detect suspicious probes and malware,

00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:54.395
proxy services for Internet browsing,

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:57.020
additional security by implementing NAT,

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.270
which is Network Address Translation.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.274
The outside world does not communicate with internal IP addresses.

00:01:03.274 --> 00:01:05.645
It's fine if your list doesn't match this one.

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:10.770
The key takeaway is to use the wealth of recommendations in these NIST standards.
