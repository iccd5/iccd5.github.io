00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.355
Now that you've completed all of the lessons,

00:00:02.355 --> 00:00:04.600
let's pause for a second to congratulate you.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:07.830
That was a lot of material to take in, great job.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.095
Now, let's turn to the course project.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.980
You'll use a different set of virtual machines to complete these exercises.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.855
However, the setup will be the same.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.000
The project is scenario-based,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.710
you are the new security analyst at

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.100
DFI and we're going to go through your first two weeks on the job.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.235
You'll connect to the environment and perform a security audit.

00:00:26.235 --> 00:00:29.250
You will recommend new firewall and IDS rules.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.680
From there, you'll recommend VPN encryption

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.605
and demonstrate the use of that rest encryption.

00:00:34.605 --> 00:00:37.560
Finally, you will recommend areas to automate and

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:41.920
summarize all of this and report to management. You've got this.
