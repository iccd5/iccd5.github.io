00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
A common tool used to query network devices is Nmap,

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.120
which is short for network mapper.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.940
It's been around for over 20 years and has

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.095
both a command line and gooey interface known as Zenmap.

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:17.865
Go to nmap.org to learn more about it and download it.

00:00:17.865 --> 00:00:23.460
It's been around for over 20 years and it's free for your use.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.845
Let me show you how it's used.

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:30.905
Nmap or Zenmap, what you see is used to map networks.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:39.410
What I've done here is just mapped my local machine using the IP address of 127.0.0.1,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.990
and I performed an intense scan.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.960
There are many different types of scans you can

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.650
perform to show what is running on your network,

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.690
including just a quick ping scan,

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.360
which just says if a device is active,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.330
the quick scan will look for most common ports,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.455
and an intense scan looks for pretty much everything.

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:03.110
Looking at this local machine,

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.010
127.0.0.1, If we scroll down,

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.120
you see we have numerous ports that are open.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:15.095
These are basically ways to enter the computer support 135,

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:20.194
and 445, and 3389 are common for Windows.

00:01:20.194 --> 00:01:23.300
One thing to note with port 3389,

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.270
this is actually used for Windows Terminal services and we

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.440
use this for the Remote Desktop Protocol or RDP.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.885
There's a lot of really interesting information available through Nmap.

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:38.330
I recommend you take some time to go to the website,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.775
download it, and play with it.

00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:45.000
