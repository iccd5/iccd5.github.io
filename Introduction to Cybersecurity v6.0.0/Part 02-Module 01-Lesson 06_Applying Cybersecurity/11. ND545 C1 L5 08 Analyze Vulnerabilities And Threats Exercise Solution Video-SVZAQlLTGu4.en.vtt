00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
The first vulnerability you looked at on the Windows system,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.490
is shared folders and files.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:07.950
Let me show you a way to look at shared folders and

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.950
files that you could have used for this exercise.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.260
You can go to the Windows Start,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:17.310
right click, select Computer Management.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.830
In the Computer Management window,

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.130
you see the Shared Folders area.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.125
Left click the little arrow next to Shared Folders and you see Shares.

00:00:28.125 --> 00:00:29.655
If I click on that,

00:00:29.655 --> 00:00:33.630
this shows you the file shares available on this PC.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.075
Here's the one we created earlier,

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:40.395
the whatever folder on the cyber admin desktop.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:42.350
If I double click on it,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.400
it shows me what it is and who can see it.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.010
For example, everyone who can log into this PC can read its contents.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.525
This is not a folder I would want to have any sensitive information in.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:01:00.700
If there was, I would unselect "Read",

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.315
click "Apply" or "Okay",

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:08.830
and that takes away everyone's permission to be able to read the contents of this folder.

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.880
As a part of a security assessment,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.660
you should review the file shares to ensure they're appropriate and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.510
that only the ones who need to have access to it can see,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:20.900
read, or change it.
