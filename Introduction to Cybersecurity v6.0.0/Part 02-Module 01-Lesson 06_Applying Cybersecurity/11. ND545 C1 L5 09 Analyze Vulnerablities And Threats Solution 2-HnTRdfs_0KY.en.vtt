00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
Another common Windows vulnerability you explored with this exercise are the services,

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.240
the executable programs running in the background of computer systems.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.265
To do this on the Windows platform,

00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:14.085
once again, go to Computer Management window.

00:00:14.085 --> 00:00:18.210
Here you can see the services and applications.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.600
To see the services running on a Windows platform,

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.940
go to the Computer Management window,

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.600
click on the arrow next to Services and Applications,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.945
and then highlight or click on "Services".

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:36.070
This shows all of the background programs running on a Windows system.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.420
As you can see, there are many of them.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.150
For example, click on

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.550
the Geolocation Service to see how this PC tracks the location of the users.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.405
If you double-click on it,

00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:52.820
you can read the description and learn more about

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.460
it and change whether it's running or not.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.460
For example, if I wanted to stop the Geolocation,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.035
I would click on "Stop".

00:01:00.035 --> 00:01:05.000
Just be aware of the impacts that'll have on the PC,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.980
if you're stopping a running service,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.035
you can accidentally break things.

00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:13.429
You'll see there are many services running by default on a Windows PC.

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:16.280
As a beginning IT or cybersecurity student,

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.600
you're not expected to know what all of these services mean.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.975
Use the description to learn more about each.

00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:26.150
This is a good opportunity to familiarize yourself

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.060
with typical services on a Windows operating system.
