00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
These are my recommendations to Jill and

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.275
Roy on what they need to do to protect their computer systems,

00:00:07.275 --> 00:00:09.150
including the least privilege,

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.460
reducing that administrator access,

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.535
not allowing client data on personal devices,

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:17.655
using antivirus software, and having

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:21.315
only work-related software on their business computers.

00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:25.365
Set the user credentials to protect the network.

00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:28.215
Don't allow remote access where it's not needed.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:35.210
Lastly, require updates and upgrades as soon as they're available from the manufacturer.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:40.925
Least privilege means only accessing information you need to do your job.

00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:45.425
Don't have access to too many things because that puts you on the suspect list.

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:48.920
Keep your resources at a minimum that you need

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.345
access to and that way you and your company stay out of trouble.

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:58.390
You want to make sure you also have a data security protection policy in place.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.695
This is the expectations and the rules for employees as to how,

00:01:03.695 --> 00:01:07.270
where, when they may access client data.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.905
The basic rule, no client information on personal devices.

00:01:11.905 --> 00:01:15.440
For device security, ensure that antivirus,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.595
anti-malware software is available on all devices,

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:22.040
both personal and at the office.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.010
This reduces the chance of some type of a virus,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.705
worm or Trojan horse affecting Jill and Roy's business.

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:34.865
Guarding against malicious actors means controlling what is available on each of the PCs.

00:01:34.865 --> 00:01:36.740
In other words, no games,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.585
no unauthorized streaming software,

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:44.055
just focus on business applications on business systems.

00:01:44.055 --> 00:01:49.220
For authentication, you want to require a password policy on the system,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.920
like you saw how to create within Windows 10 using

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:54.980
the local security policy, password policy.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.970
This requires valid user ID and a password or

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.325
a passphrase credentials to log in to each of the systems.

00:02:03.325 --> 00:02:04.800
For the IT contract,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.910
you want to ensure the system is continually backed

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.350
up and want to do it daily or weekly at the worst.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.125
To make sure you're not losing sensitive and critical business data,

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:24.035
make sure you're updating all PCs as soon as patches are available from the vendors.

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.550
This may be done weekly,

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.370
sometimes monthly and then definitely if there

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.865
is a critical patch that comes from a vendor,

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:36.680
this is just some of my recommendations for Jill and Roy's Accounting.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.175
Presenting as if I'm presenting to their management,

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:42.560
you may come up with different answers.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.560
But the idea is for you to give Jill and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.595
Roy ideas on how to secure their business environment.

00:02:49.595 --> 00:02:52.770
Hope you had fun with this exercise.
