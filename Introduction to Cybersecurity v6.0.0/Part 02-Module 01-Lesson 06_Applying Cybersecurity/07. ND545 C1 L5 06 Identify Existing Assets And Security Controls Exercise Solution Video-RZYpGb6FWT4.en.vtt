00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.640
In this exercise, you identified existing assets on the exercises Windows 10 VM.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.350
This is so you could analyze those assets to determine and categorize risks,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.810
threats, vulnerabilities, and exploits.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.850
For part 1 of the exercise,

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.300
first sign into the Windows 10 virtual PC.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.040
Once there, right-click on the Start bar,

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.370
we often think about using the left mouse button,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.970
but the right one often has many more options.

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.290
From here, review the different options such as Apps and Features,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.755
and Event Viewer shows you what has happened on this PC.

00:00:39.755 --> 00:00:42.740
System provides system information.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.300
Device Manager shows what devices are connected to the PC.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.555
Network Connections is how you can set up the network.

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:54.190
This is the layering of defense we learned about earlier.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.245
Disk management is how you can manage the hard disks associated with this system,

00:01:00.245 --> 00:01:07.250
and Computer Management provides a lot of different options for managing this local PC.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.310
I'll start by showing the System.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.590
When you right-click on System info from the start bar,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.060
it shows you all of the information about this particular PC,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.455
including if virus and threat protection is on and firewalls.

00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:27.370
What type of application and browser controls?

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.065
Do you have identity and account protection, and device security?

00:01:31.065 --> 00:01:34.040
Also shows you the device name,

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.495
the type of processor,

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:42.125
amount of RAM, and the system type like this is a 64-bit operating system.

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:45.530
You also can see the windows specification,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.425
which is the version of the Windows operating system.

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:52.325
This is Windows 10 Pro using version 1909,

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:54.335
and when it was installed.

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:58.280
I'll often use this system information to tell me if

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.240
this PC needs to be updated with patches or the latest upgrade for Microsoft.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.170
Another option when you right-click is absent features.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.795
When you right-click on Apps and Features,

00:02:11.795 --> 00:02:18.790
this basically shows you all of the applications available within this Windows PC.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.550
You can see when it was installed and how much space they are taking.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.710
If you're running out of disk space,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.000
maybe you want to uninstall one of these applications and hey, look,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.790
we have lots of games installed that just happen to

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.540
be installed by default with Windows 10,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.090
these actually could be uninstalled.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.830
Just click on it and you can choose the uninstall option.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.130
Use the Apps and Features to determine what are

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.785
viable applications that should be on this PC based on the business need.

00:02:51.785 --> 00:02:57.790
I'll now show you Computer Management when you right-click the start bar.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.925
Computer Management has a lot of additional information about the system,

00:03:01.925 --> 00:03:04.415
including an event viewer.

00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:07.220
This shows what has been happening on the system.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.600
Shared folders.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.120
If you recall from a previous video,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.924
we can use this to determine what folders have been shared with which users,

00:03:16.924 --> 00:03:22.430
the local users and groups will show the users that are on this system.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.775
If there were any accounts created that shouldn't be,

00:03:25.775 --> 00:03:28.025
we can go here to remove them.

00:03:28.025 --> 00:03:33.650
We can also create a new user in this window by right-clicking.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.690
Again, think of right-click rather than left,

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.295
right-clicking and selecting "New User".

00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:41.900
Also available from Computer Management is

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.900
the option to view the services and applications.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.905
If I click the little arrow next to services and applications,

00:03:48.905 --> 00:03:54.335
select "Services", you can see all of the different services running on this system.

00:03:54.335 --> 00:03:59.655
These are the little programs that are in the background we often don't consider.

00:03:59.655 --> 00:04:03.175
There are many options within Computer Management.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:08.765
Take some time to explore either on your own or using this virtual PC.

00:04:08.765 --> 00:04:11.065
In the last part of this exercise,

00:04:11.065 --> 00:04:12.609
you once again review

00:04:12.609 --> 00:04:17.425
the local security policy that is just found by going to the run bar

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:24.670
type local security policy and click on the App within the local security policy,

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:27.880
you can click on Account Policies to be able

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.330
to see the password policy and the account lockout.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:38.370
You can also use the local policies and set an audit policy. What does this mean?

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:44.290
Well, this is what is locked about the events that are happening this local PC.

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.220
For example, when people log in,

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.440
right now there's no auditing.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.350
But if I want to capture anytime anyone has

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.605
successfully logged in or there were any failures,

00:04:54.605 --> 00:04:59.210
I can just select the checkboxes next to each of these option.

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:05.200
You can always click on the explain tab to learn more about this particular function.

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.885
When I'm ready, I click "Apply" then "Okay",

00:05:09.885 --> 00:05:16.315
and you can see now that account management will log any success or failures.

00:05:16.315 --> 00:05:24.155
Under security options, there's a lot of different capabilities and configuration items.

00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:27.620
Take some time to look and read through these,

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.580
understand what they mean and how they work.

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:33.980
I'll leave it up to you to spend some time to

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.655
review these as there's a lot of information here.

00:05:37.655 --> 00:05:41.870
Local security policy is where you set all of

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.850
the policies for this local machine regarding security and privacy settings.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:52.620
Take some time to read through these and understand how each of them work.
