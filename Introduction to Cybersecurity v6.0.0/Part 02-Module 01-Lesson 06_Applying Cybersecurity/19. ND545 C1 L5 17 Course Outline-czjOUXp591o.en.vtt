00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.005
This concludes the first course of the Udacity cybersecurity nanodegree.

00:00:05.005 --> 00:00:07.630
At this point, you should have a good idea why

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:10.480
cybersecurity is so critical in today's world,

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.720
and what it means to be safe and secure online.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.650
In the course, you learned what it means to maintain a secure infrastructure and

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.840
administer a system that meets industry security standards.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.555
Then you got to think like a hacker in assessing high-level risks,

00:00:25.555 --> 00:00:28.235
vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks.

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:30.865
Once you know how a data breach may happen,

00:00:30.865 --> 00:00:33.265
you need to enable adequate defenses,

00:00:33.265 --> 00:00:35.935
which was covered in lesson 5.

00:00:35.935 --> 00:00:37.705
With all of this knowledge,

00:00:37.705 --> 00:00:43.610
you practiced applying cybersecurity on a sample system using a case study.
