00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
There are many threats and vulnerabilities you might

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.690
identify in the Jill and Roy's Accounting Case Study,

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.875
and consequently, many recommendations you can make.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:11.670
In the real world, you might write a report to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.030
accompany a presentation you would give to management.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.655
For the purposes of this exercise, however,

00:00:17.655 --> 00:00:20.895
here are some risks and recommendations that I developed.

00:00:20.895 --> 00:00:25.590
My analysis identified six important risks to Jill and Roy's accounting.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.925
The first was administrative access to all of the PCs.

00:00:29.925 --> 00:00:34.920
Second, the personal computers were handling business data.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.225
Third, the Bring Your Own Device Policy for cellphones.

00:00:39.225 --> 00:00:44.734
Then you notice that there were some games and streaming software on their business PC.

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:47.870
Remote access to the company file server,

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:51.725
which could enable malware or ransomware on it.

00:00:51.725 --> 00:00:55.805
The update frequency specified by the IT contract,

00:00:55.805 --> 00:00:58.600
basically how often they update patches.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.365
Let's talk about each of these one by one.

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:05.750
For administrative access, the risk here is that

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.200
if all users have admin authority on the PC,

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.120
they can install any software they want,

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.685
they can make any changes they want.

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:19.520
This is very risky because you don't know what they could do or what they could install.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.335
Recommendation is remove administrative access for end users.

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:27.395
Let them use the standard user account in Windows 10.

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.990
Another problem for Jill and Roy's is that

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.590
temporary workers are using their own computers.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.790
They could accidentally download some company information or

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:43.535
personal information for one of Jill and Roy's clients under their own personal machine.

00:01:43.535 --> 00:01:47.090
This is a risk because you can lose control of that data,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.865
leading to an inadvertent data breach.

00:01:49.865 --> 00:01:54.815
A bring Your Own Device Policy is often in place for many organizations.

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:58.520
The challenge is, is you need to make sure that you provide

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.480
the policies and standards for how people can use their smartphones.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.300
It's okay to use it for general e-mail.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.090
Don't allow standard users to be able to

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.380
download any personal information from any of the clients.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.705
So tell your employees who use Bring Your Own Device,

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:16.970
what their expectations are.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:20.350
You should've also noticed on the Windows 10 system that there

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.780
are games and employees were using it to play games.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.670
This is a business machine,

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.080
it really should be called a BC,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.230
not a PC, business computer instead of personal computer.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.170
I recommend removing games because they could

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.815
contain malware and they are a distraction for the business.

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:41.700
Remote access is often dangerous for computer systems

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:47.050
because you can't always control who can access it remotely across the Internet.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.950
I recommend turning off Remote Desktop Protocol, or RDP,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.780
on all PCs where you can or at least restrict using a firewall,

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.535
how people can connect to it.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:02.340
You don't want just anyone from the Internet on your computers.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.890
Another thought is to check the update frequency on that PC.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.670
You want to make sure that it's patched from the Microsoft Patch Tuesday.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.580
Another thing is to back it up daily,

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:19.290
if not weekly, just to make sure you don't lose any critical files.
