00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
For the project, once you have access to the Azure Virtual Environment,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.290
you need to login to Joe's Windows 10 PC using the assigned user ID and password.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.545
Let me show you what it looks like.

00:00:14.545 --> 00:00:18.390
Once you log into Joe's Auto's Windows 10 PC,

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.165
click on the ReadMe file on the desktop.

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.115
From the ReadMe file,

00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:25.440
you can learn more about the scenario.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.110
This is also repeated in the document template

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.305
file you've received as a part of this project.

00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:33.434
On this Windows 10 PC,

00:00:33.434 --> 00:00:36.090
you should take the time to explore it using

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.540
the examples I provided throughout this course.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.690
Explore everything you can about

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.755
the operating system and all of the applications on the system.

00:00:45.755 --> 00:00:50.215
This is your Windows 10 PC to explore and play on.

00:00:50.215 --> 00:00:54.590
You can make whatever changes you want and it won't affect anybody else.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:01.315
This is your playground to learn and explore about Windows 10 and Cybersecurity.

00:01:01.315 --> 00:01:02.810
From here on out,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.995
use the project template provided with the class.

00:01:05.995 --> 00:01:10.400
Fill out your information in your project template and be sure to

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.250
document all of your answers and show your work with screenshots.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.820
Have fun with this Windows 10 exercise and good luck.
