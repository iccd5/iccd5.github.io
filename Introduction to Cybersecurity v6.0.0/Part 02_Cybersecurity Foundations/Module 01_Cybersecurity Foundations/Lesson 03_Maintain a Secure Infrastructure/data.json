In this lesson, you'll learn about influential, international organizations that develop and maintain the standards used by companies worldwide to defend data, computers, and networks.\n\nThere are organizations responsible for setting the standards in the US and Internationally. There are also ones that focus on specific areas. \n* In the United States, that organization is the **National Institute of Standards and Technology**, also known as NIST. \n* The **International Organization for Standards** or ISO works with the International Electrotechnical Commission or IEC to set worldwide technology standards. \n* There are also governing bodies that set the rules for specific areas. For example, the **Payment Card Industry** (PCI) has the Data Security Standards that are required for any business accepting or handling credit card data. \n\nWhy do we need security standards? \n* For safety, to make sure technology doesn’t cause problems for people or other technologies\n* Allow technology interconnectivity\n* Make sure everyone is playing by the same rules (this is known as compliance)\n* For efficiency",

This step assists you with recognizing the valuable technology, data, and other resources your company owns.\n\n- The second function, **Protect**: ways you can secure the items you identified in step one. Ways to establish valid protection come in many forms, including nontechnical human components, such as security awareness. On the other side are technical products or services requiring some level of expertise, such as network security with firewalls and web filters, malware and virus protection, patching and updating, and encryption.\n\n- The third function, **Detect**: a real or potential incident as quickly as possible. This allows you to quickly and easily respond and recover. Detect is a process of developing and implementing activities to identify the occurrence of a cybersecurity event, with a focus on *finding* of such events. \n\n- The fourth function, **Respond**: Once you detect a problem, whether it’s a security breach, network outage, or system misconfiguration, you need to *respond*. This is your plan for handling incidents to ensure minimal organizational impacts. \n\n- The fifth function, **Recovery**: when an incident is properly responded, you may need to recover your organizational activities. To get your operations quickly back to normal can lessen the financial and human costs of a cybersecurity incident. The more resilient you are, the less your organization is effected. \n\nBy using the NIST CSF functions and categories, organizations experience fewer breaches and security compliance issues.",

The Center for Internet Security is a non-profit organization that leads a global community of IT professionals in developing security standards to safeguard against emerging threats. \n\nTheir best practices are made up of two parts: \n* The Critical Security Controls, also known as the CIS CSC or CIS Controls™ which are the top 20 activities for organizational security.\n* The CIS Benchmarks™ are guidelines to secure or lockdown operating systems, software, applications and networks\n\nThey are both developed by a community of cybersecurity professionals from many different areas with the goal of establishing a form of a checklist of activities as organizations mature their cybersecurity programs. \n\nThe CIS Controls™ is separated into three functional areas that the CIS calls Implementation Groups: \n- Basic Controls\n- Foundational Controls\n- Organizational Controls\n\n\n## Further research\n* CIS Best Practices: https://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-best-practices/ \n* CIS Controls List: https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/cis-controls-list/",

They employ 7 full-time workers: 4 accountants, 1 office administrator, and themselves. They also have about a dozen seasonal workers during tax season. \n\nThey use Microsoft 365 (aka Office 365) for all of their office applications (email, word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). For their accounting, they use Intuit's Quickbooks and ProConnect online versions. They have a single office with a network router to their ISP, a Linksys LGS116P Ethernet Switch and a Linksys AC1900 WiFi Router. \n\nThe full-time accountants each have a Lenovo ThinkPad T490 and the office administrator has a Lenovo desktop. All company workstation computers use Windows 10 and all users have administrator access on their PC. They also have one internal Windows 10 Lenovo desktop that they use as a centralized print and file server that sits in the main office area. Only Roy, Jill and the office admin have an account on it. The temporary workers use their own laptops, which are a mixture of Windows and Macs. \n\nThe office has a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy for all cell phones. They have a contract with a local IT company to provide services, which includes a weekly backup of the file/print server, monthly updating of all computers, and maintenance of the network equipment. \n\nFor each of the CIS Controls below, provide your interpretation of how they may apply to Jill & Roy's Accounting.
