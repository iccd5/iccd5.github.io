Anything that’s not on the list is automatically denied from being installed or used. \n\nOnce you have an inventory, all organizations should address any unauthorized hardware or software assets on the network.",

              "text": "## Analyze Vulnerabilities and Threats\nIn this lesson, we’ll look at three primary areas within a Windows Operating System that may contain vulnerabilities:\n\n* **Shared folders and files** - Folders and files are often shared by users to make it easier for others to view or modify them. \n>The threat is that you don’t always know who may be able to see or change their content. Ransomware is another threat that will often try to lock file shares on a network until the ransom is paid. It’s good to know what files and folders are shared on both a PC and across a network\n\n* **Windows Services** - These are executable applications that often run continuously in the background. They can be automatically started when a computer starts. Trigger events can also start services, like when you run a particular application.  Services running that aren’t needed can bog down a computer. \n> A potential security threat is that running services can allow unauthorized access to the computer or its contents.\n\n* **Windows and Application Updates** \n> Malicious software is a continual threat to unpatched systems and applications. Other threats include unauthorized access to the system or data or the disclosure of sensitive data.\n\n\n## Further research\n* Common Vulnerabilities and Enumeration (CVE) - https://cve.mitre.org/\n* Microsoft Security Resource Center (MSCR), Security Update Guide - https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance",

This can be done with technical settings,  corporate policies, user training, or all three. You can use the CIS Controls™ for guidance on how you should secure computer systems.\n\nSecure the Configuration of Software, Operating Systems & Networks includes the following steps:\n* Application Security - Remove unneeded applications and make sure the rest are up-to-date on patches.\n* End-Point Protection - Make sure antivirus and firewall applications are on and they stay up to date. For Windows 10, this is known as Windows Defender. \n* Security Policy settings - Configure the operating system to log events\n\nAccess Control includes:\n* Account ownership\n* Administrative Privileges \n* Limit accounts in the Administrator group\n* User Account Control (UAC) on Windows\n\nImplement Security Awareness\n* Best practices for keeping systems, applications, and data safe\n* Company policies\n* Throughout the year verified annually\n\n\n## Further research\n- StaySafeOnline: \"[Free Online Security Checkups and Tools](https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/securing-home-network/)\" \n- StaySafeOnline: \"[Securing Your Home](https://staysafeonline.org/stay-safe-online/securing-key-accounts-devices/securing-home-network/)\"\n\n\n",

But notice that more information has been added.\n\nJill and Roy provide accounting services throughout their area. They employ 7 full-time workers: 4 accountants, 1 office administrator, and themselves. They also have about a dozen seasonal workers during tax season. \n\nThey use Microsoft 365 (aka Office 365) for all of their office applications (email, word processing, spreadsheets, etc.). For their accounting, they use Intuit's Quickbooks and ProConnect online versions. They have a single office with a network router to their ISP, a Linksys LGS116P Ethernet Switch and a Linksys AC1900 WiFi Router. \n\nThe full-time accountants each have a Lenovo ThinkPad T490 and the office administrator has a Lenovo desktop. All company workstation computers use Windows 10 and Google Chrome for their standard web browser. All users have administrator rights on their PC and many have installed their own software, which includes games and media streaming applications. \n\nThey also have one internal Windows 10 Lenovo desktop that they use as a centralized print and file server that sits in the main office area. Only Roy, Jill, and the office admin have an account on it. They recently allowed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) into it to allow employees to access files from home. The temporary workers use their own laptops, which are a mixture of Windows and Macs. It's known that some of the temporary accountant workers will download client files onto their personal computers to work offline.  \n\nThe office has a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) Policy for all cell phones (a mix of Apple iPhones and Android). Cell phones are used for business email and to speak with office workers and clients. \n\nJill & Roys has a contract with a local IT company to provide services, which includes a weekly backup of the file/print server, monthly updating of Microsoft products on office computers, and maintenance of the network equipment. \n\nAnswer the questions below based on this case study.

At this point, you should have a good idea of why cybersecurity is so critical in today's world and what it means to be secure online. In the course, you learned what it means to maintain a secure infrastructure and administer a system that meets industry security standards. You need to think like a hacker in assessing high-level risks, vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks. Once you know how a data breach may happen, you need to enable adequate defenses. With all of this knowledge, you practiced applying cybersecurity on a sample system using a case study.\n\n## Course learning objective\nNow you should be able to:\n* Explain security fundamentals including core security principles, critical security controls, and cybersecurity best practices. \n* Evaluate specific security techniques used to administer a system that meets industry standards and core controls\n* Assess high-level risks, vulnerabilities and attack vectors of a sample system\n* Explain methods for establishing and maintaining the security of a network, computing environment, and application.\n",
