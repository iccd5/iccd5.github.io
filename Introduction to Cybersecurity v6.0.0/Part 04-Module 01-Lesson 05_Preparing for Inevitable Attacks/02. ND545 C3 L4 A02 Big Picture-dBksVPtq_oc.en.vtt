00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
Again, bringing this back to the art of

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.005
war: You know your enemy at this point, which are the threats.

00:00:07.005 --> 00:00:09.870
You have a better understanding of yourself.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.150
You know your weaknesses or vulnerabilities,

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.680
and you even have plans for fixing them to mitigate the risk,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.165
but that's not where this ends.

00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:24.010
Fully preparing for this battle against cyber threats

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.680
means you must be prepared to respond when an attack happens.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.185
Breaches, especially at large companies,

00:00:31.185 --> 00:00:33.795
can cause significant financial,

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:37.195
reputational, and regulatory consequences,

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:39.985
especially when they're not handled properly.

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:44.390
For example, Uber landed in hot water after responding to

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.360
a breach with an alleged cover-up attempt to pay off the attackers.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.100
So not only did it cost them money,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.100
but their reputation took a huge hit as well.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.140
How you respond matters.
