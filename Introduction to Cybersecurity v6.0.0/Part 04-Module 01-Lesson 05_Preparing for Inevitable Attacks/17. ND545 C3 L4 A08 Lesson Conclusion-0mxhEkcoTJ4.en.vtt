00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
While it's best to be proactive and prevent

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.900
security threats from being a problem as early as possible,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.240
you can't prevent everything.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.620
So eventually something will go wrong and it's important to prepare for that.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.580
Cybersecurity breaches are on the rise and so having a solid process for responding and

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.145
containing the incident can save companies

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:27.135
millions of dollars in damages and prevent catastrophe.

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:29.830
That's what incident response is all about.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.445
At this point, you now know the relationship between incident response,

00:00:34.445 --> 00:00:37.775
disaster recovery, and business continuity.

00:00:37.775 --> 00:00:41.000
You also know how to distinguish events from

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.145
incidence and recognize indicators of compromise.

00:00:45.145 --> 00:00:48.880
You've also learned about the incident response life cycle,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.004
the important roles in the process,

00:00:51.004 --> 00:00:53.410
as well as planning, and digital forensics.

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.010
These are all critical parts to knowing how to respond to incidents.
