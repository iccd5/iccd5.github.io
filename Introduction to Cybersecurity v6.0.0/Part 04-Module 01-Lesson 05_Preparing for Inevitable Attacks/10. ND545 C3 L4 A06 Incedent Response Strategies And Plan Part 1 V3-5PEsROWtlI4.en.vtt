00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.735
An incident response plan is the documentation of

00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:07.335
a predetermined set of procedures to detect,

00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:10.830
respond to, and limit consequences of

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.690
a malicious cyber attack against an organization's systems.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.790
Common elements of an incident response planning process include,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.870
first, establishing roles and contact information.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.630
So having trained staff who know exactly what to do and

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.675
how to notify the right people as an important part of incident response planning.

00:00:34.675 --> 00:00:38.025
Also, outlining notification steps.

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:42.725
Many different groups may require notification throughout the incident.

00:00:42.725 --> 00:00:47.570
For example, you have to notify impacted customers or

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.320
subjects when their personal data has been leaked under some regulations.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.745
In order to communicate that,

00:00:55.745 --> 00:01:02.165
you probably need someone from your communications or public relations team to step in,

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:05.275
and those triggers must be clear.

00:01:05.275 --> 00:01:11.225
Also, creating an incident procedure checklist is another component.

00:01:11.225 --> 00:01:13.430
The incident checklist is

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.925
the step-by-step playbook for responders and one of the most important parts.

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:22.710
Well, they should tell you step-by-step what to do.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.000
The reality of cyber incidents is that there will always

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.390
be curved balls and gaps that don't have answers,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.780
and so you have to be flexible enough to adapt

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.330
quickly in these situations and still press on with response.

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:43.820
Another element is determining how to categorize and prioritize incidence.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.595
Just like threats and vulnerabilities have different severity levels, so do incidence.

00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:55.120
Every incident won't warrant complete incident response team activation.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.045
It's important to outline what triggers,

00:01:59.045 --> 00:02:03.065
what incident types and severities matter the most.

00:02:03.065 --> 00:02:06.535
This is usually done based on impact.

00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:10.400
A greater potential impact from an incident would lead

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.380
to that being prioritized and addressed before more minor ones.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.200
Also providing guidance on business continuity and disaster recovery triggers

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:27.440
and outlining the steps to take when incident response simply is not enough.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.040
Finally, you need provisions for a continuous improvement process.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.355
This cannot be overlooked.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:38.810
Lessons learned are golden in incident response,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.500
and can be used to make you better and faster at addressing incidents in the future.

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.460
The incident response plan usually gets activated when there is

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.169
a credible indicator of compromise or confirmed incident.

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.955
It's important to distinguish what constitutes an event from an incident.

00:02:58.955 --> 00:03:01.715
All events are not incidence,

00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:04.700
but all incidence involve events.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.455
I'll break that down a bit.

00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:13.765
An event is any observable occurrence or action that happens in an information system.

00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:16.715
While an incident is an occurrence,

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:23.390
much like an event that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality,

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.940
integrity, or availability of a system.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.990
So incidence typically pose an imminent threat

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:33.965
of violation of security policies and procedures.

00:03:33.965 --> 00:03:39.140
For example, I found myself dealing with the situation in my career where I learned that

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.534
an entire internal database with sensitive information was posted online,

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:47.690
and this was immediately considered an incident.

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.300
In fact, it's a breach.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.285
A common way to detect whether an event

00:03:53.285 --> 00:03:57.365
is an incident is through indicators of compromise.

00:03:57.365 --> 00:04:02.809
These are known signals that suggests a potential event is indeed an incident.

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:07.715
For example, I found myself in another situation earlier in my career where

00:04:07.715 --> 00:04:12.860
I got a notification that looked like a potential indicator of compromise,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.565
and so an application system went offline and

00:04:16.565 --> 00:04:21.260
users couldn't access it for a few hours and then it randomly came back up.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.105
Now, could it be an event?

00:04:23.105 --> 00:04:26.405
Could it be an incident? I had to explore.

00:04:26.405 --> 00:04:33.290
I had to think through possibilities and also do some research by looking through logs,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.475
detection systems and more in order to figure out what might be going on.

00:04:37.475 --> 00:04:41.105
Well, it turns out the system was offline for routine updates,

00:04:41.105 --> 00:04:44.555
but some users just didn't see the email notification.

00:04:44.555 --> 00:04:46.955
So because it's routine maintenance,

00:04:46.955 --> 00:04:48.290
it's not an incident,

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.135
but it is indeed an event.

00:04:50.135 --> 00:04:52.415
However, if in this example,

00:04:52.415 --> 00:04:57.050
I found that the availability was degraded because it was

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.810
being hit with fake traffic or there was

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.620
a sketchy process running that ate up all of the CPU power,

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.380
then that might be considered an incident.

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.540
In summary, an indicator of compromise can help you distinguish an event from

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.460
an incident in order to determine if you should activate your incident response plan.
