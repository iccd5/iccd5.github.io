00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
Now that we've identified where incident response

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.940
falls into the contingency planning process,

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.515
let's dig into that more.

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:11.100
Now, the incident response process has several phases.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.705
Those phases are preparation, detection and analysis,

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:18.645
containment, eradication and recovery,

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:21.495
and finally, post incident activity.

00:00:21.495 --> 00:00:24.510
The first phase, preparation,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.500
involves building and training an incident response team.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.730
It also includes gathering the right tools and

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.735
resources to adequately respond to incidents.

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:40.460
During preparation, the organization works to mitigate risk and

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.725
reduce the number of incidents that may occur by implementing security controls as well.

00:00:45.725 --> 00:00:52.265
Either way, some residual risk will continue to exist after controls are implemented,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:56.420
which is why incident response preparation is so important.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.630
Being able to detect and analyze incidence,

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.040
which is the next phase,

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.280
is a necessary step in order to fully understand

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.860
the incident and alert the appropriate context whenever the incident occurs.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.769
This step is critical because in reality,

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:15.185
it can take companies days, months,

00:01:15.185 --> 00:01:18.545
and sometimes years to detect an incident.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.840
Based on the severity of the incident,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.780
the organization can mitigate impact by

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.645
containing and addressing the incident and ultimately recovering from it.

00:01:28.645 --> 00:01:32.585
During this phase, sometimes it creates a loop

00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:36.440
between containment and detection and analysis.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.965
For example, with the way malware can spread quickly,

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:44.840
you may find that as you remove it and work to recover in one area,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.685
it gets discovered in another and the process starts again.

00:01:49.685 --> 00:01:56.175
After the incident is contained and recovery is well underway or complete,

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:59.330
the organization creates reports that include

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.335
information on the cause and financial impact of the incident,

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:08.585
as well as lessons learned and steps the company can take to avoid future incidence.

00:02:08.585 --> 00:02:13.520
The entire incident response life cycle requires support and input

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.300
from various key players within an organization to make it work effectively.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.045
There's usually a dedicated incident response team

00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:26.075
that includes representatives from various groups.

00:02:26.075 --> 00:02:28.910
The main planning in orchestration responsibility

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.060
typically lies with the cyber security staff.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.310
These are the people, for example,

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.080
who manage the cyber security incident detection technology and other resources.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.009
The management team establishes incident response policy,

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:49.210
budget and staffing, which are fundamental pieces in the incident response team process.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.980
Next, IT support may also be needed during certain stages of incident handling.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.045
For example, to change firewall rules in the middle of an incident.

00:02:59.045 --> 00:03:01.910
Also, legal experts can help,

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:06.590
especially in an incident where there might be legal ramifications,

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.365
including evidence collection, prosecution of a suspect or other matters.

00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:16.280
Digital forensics experts are also another element here,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.325
and we'll talk about that a little more later.

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:22.070
Next, depending on the magnitude and impact of the incident,

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.940
you might need public affairs and media relations resources

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.790
to inform the media and by extension, the public.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.340
You could also need HR involvement if, for example,

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.920
you're dealing with a malicious insider who needs

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.905
to be reprimanded or potentially terminated.

00:03:39.905 --> 00:03:41.935
The list goes on and on.

00:03:41.935 --> 00:03:45.200
But the bottom line is that when you're dealing with incident response,

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.930
it truly takes a village.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.580
The incident response life cycle can require

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.820
support from people outside of the organization as well,

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:55.400
such as law enforcement agencies,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.870
Internet service providers, support vendors and more.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.900
For example, if you're experiencing a denial of

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.980
service incident where you are being flooded with fake traffic,

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.160
you may contact your Internet service provider to

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.780
block that traffic and slow or stop the incident.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.554
Another example, if you're dealing with a cyber terrorist,

00:04:17.554 --> 00:04:21.290
you may need to get law enforcement or the FBI involved.

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:24.255
Or if you're dealing with a zero-day exploit,

00:04:24.255 --> 00:04:29.185
you may work with your vendor or your support team to address the issue.

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.850
The last example I'll share is that there are

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.730
trusted information sharing organizations that

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.150
incident response teams participate in so that they can learn from

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.025
each other about the latest attack attempts and trends.

00:04:42.025 --> 00:04:47.240
The incident response team should document all of this contact information and all of

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.390
these exchanges with external parties to make sure that you're

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:54.570
covered from a liability standpoint and also as evidence.
