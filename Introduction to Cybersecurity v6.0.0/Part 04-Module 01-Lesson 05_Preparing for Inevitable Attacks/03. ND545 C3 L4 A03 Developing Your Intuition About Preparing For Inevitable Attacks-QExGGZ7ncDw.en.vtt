00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Incident response is about preparing and

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.735
reacting in case a threat is successfully activated.

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:08.865
Let's remember our home example,

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:12.450
where you left for work and your window was wide open.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.915
You come home and you realize someone's in the house,

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:21.390
you hear rumbling upstairs which means maybe the intruder is likely still there.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.265
What do you do?

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:27.975
Do you leave so you remain safe and then call for help?

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:30.870
Do you go and confront the threat actor?

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:34.595
Do you turn on your remote enabled webcam upstairs,

00:00:34.595 --> 00:00:36.995
so you have evidence of what's going on?

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.575
There are so many different options and

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:44.345
each one can make or break your ability to save your belongings,

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:47.200
and in drastic cases save your life.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.970
Now how hard would it be to decide on

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.420
those things under pressure and in the moment if you

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.540
hadn't thought about it before versus if you had

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.825
a clearly written plan to follow when you're being robbed,

00:00:59.825 --> 00:01:02.750
who to call, where to go for safety,

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.590
how to fight back if you have no other option.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.800
The same applies in incident response.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:15.325
Once, I found myself in a situation where I had to deal with the ransomware incident.

00:01:15.325 --> 00:01:20.600
Now, ransomware is an attack method where the hacker essentially encrypts

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.840
or locks up your data and then asks you to pay ransom in order for them to unlock it.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.965
Well, on this fateful day,

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:32.825
someone had clicked on a phishing e-mail that included ransomware,

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:35.305
and so it encrypted their machine.

00:01:35.305 --> 00:01:38.285
But what you may not realize about ransomware, however,

00:01:38.285 --> 00:01:40.385
is that in some cases,

00:01:40.385 --> 00:01:45.380
it will also try to encrypt any other connected machines as well.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.225
So it can take down a company's entire network.

00:01:49.225 --> 00:01:51.810
In this case, in my experience,

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.315
it spread like gossip in high school.

00:01:54.315 --> 00:01:58.940
Let's just say a lot of people were locked out of important systems that day.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.170
Thankfully, I was prepared and I had a plan.

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.605
By involving the right people at the right time

00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:10.550
and also having prepared in advance with backups,

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.139
a few hours later,

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:14.479
you wouldn't have known anything happened.

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:17.365
That's the power of incident response.

00:02:17.365 --> 00:02:22.100
The truth is, bad things will happen and you have to have a plan in

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.590
place before the attack occurs so that you can respond in ways that are most effective.
