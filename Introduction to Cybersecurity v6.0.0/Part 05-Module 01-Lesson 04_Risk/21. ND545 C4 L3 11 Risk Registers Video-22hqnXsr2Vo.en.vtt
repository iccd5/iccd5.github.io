00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
Now I mentioned maturity,

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:06.510
most fairly mature risk assessing organizations maintain

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.700
risk registers that are used to track

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.590
the state of security risks for the entire organization.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:14.520
All of that risk treatment decision-making,

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.310
that you make as an organization needs to be

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.255
captured in that risk register. Why do you keep one?

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:25.080
I mentioned the first objective of a risk register already.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.470
It's to keep track of organizational risk,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.230
and that allows you to report to stakeholders,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.805
and your senior leadership,

00:00:32.805 --> 00:00:35.340
the organization's risk posture.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.505
Also, management exceptions.

00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:42.225
When you choose not to mitigate risk or accept it,

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:44.900
you can demonstrate that the organization made

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.005
an informed decision and then chose not to address certain risk.

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.720
Not having those in the risk register may

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.895
signify that you didn't know about the risk in the first place.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:00.950
Then finally, it also provides evidence

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.770
of an effective and mature Risk Management program.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.800
In this way, the risk register itself acts as a security control.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.779
Now, risk registers don't need to be complex,

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:15.275
they are intended to be a little recording of the risks

00:01:15.275 --> 00:01:20.020
your organization have addressed and their associated risk treatment.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.775
Now this slide probably looks pretty familiar,

00:01:22.775 --> 00:01:26.275
it should look a lot like our risk assessment slide.

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:28.820
Remember in our risk assessment slide,

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.985
we had a risk statement, the likelihood,

00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:34.879
the impact, any mitigating controls,

00:01:34.879 --> 00:01:37.655
and then finally, what our residual risk is.

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:42.260
The only difference here is that we've added our risk treatment,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.865
and the risk treatment demonstrates that we've thought about the risk,

00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:52.500
and it shows what decision we've made about how we're going to treat that risk.
