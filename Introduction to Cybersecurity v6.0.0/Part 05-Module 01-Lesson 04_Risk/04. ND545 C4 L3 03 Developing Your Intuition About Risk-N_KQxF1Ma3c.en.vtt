00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
Because security risk management relies heavily on mathematical principles,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.905
we can end up with abstract assessments of risk.

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:13.829
Security risk often becomes a function of whether the likelihood in impact are critical,

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:16.215
high, medium, or low.

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.995
Meaning that risks can become a matter of experience and bias.

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:24.270
In mathematical formulas, there can be variables that transform

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.710
risk expression from a highly positive outlook to a highly negative one.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.260
But those models are adjusted over time and

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.800
measured for effectiveness against real outcomes.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.590
Here, we're dealing with a much less refined assessment mechanism.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.215
What this means is that our formula;

00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:45.304
risk equals likelihood times impact,

00:00:45.304 --> 00:00:48.970
is not really meant to be a mathematical equation.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.235
We use it just to express a measure of risk.

00:00:52.235 --> 00:00:54.965
We're not actually multiplying anything.

00:00:54.965 --> 00:00:59.450
Here's an example of a risk: a disgruntled employee publishes

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.860
your organization's entire customer contact list to an online blog.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.825
What's the likelihood of that occurring?

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:08.505
Well, I'm not sure;

00:01:08.505 --> 00:01:11.150
could we build a formula for starting to measure

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.320
mathematically what that impact might look like?

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.470
Sure. We could say that the likelihood is a function of

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.974
employee dissatisfaction times opportunity minus mitigating controls;

00:01:23.974 --> 00:01:25.895
maybe there are other factors.

00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:29.300
But how practical is it to build a formula and gather

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.970
inputs for every potential security risk,

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.655
and how much do we really know about things like measuring employee satisfaction?

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:39.095
Probably not a lot.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:42.230
So instead, we perform rough calculations about

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.180
likelihood based on experience and unique circumstances.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.435
So maybe the risk here we decide is medium.

00:01:49.435 --> 00:01:51.600
Well, what about the impact?

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.640
The same is true for impact.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.410
We could envision a formula for measuring the value of

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:01.510
an exploited risk or impact and it might look something like this.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:05.495
But how much do we know about the value of customer records

00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:09.975
or the value of an average customer contract or reputational damage?

00:02:09.975 --> 00:02:13.025
Sometimes it's difficult to find that information out.

00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:15.320
So let's call this medium as well.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.625
So in general, we're making a value judgment based on

00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:25.080
our experience and that by itself can present some risk.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.560
We'll actually allow our own experience and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.040
our own risk appetite to color our view of risk.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.820
Let's look at another example.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.080
A phishing attempt successfully exploits a user

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.920
and contaminates several workstations and servers with ransomware.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.870
What's the likelihood of that?

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.215
What's the impact? Again, I'm not sure.

00:02:45.215 --> 00:02:47.780
Let me give you some additional context.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:55.085
What if I told you that phishing is the most widely used attack vector by a large margin?

00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:58.745
Does that change your opinion or does that color your opinion?

00:02:58.745 --> 00:03:03.680
Well, what if I said that we do anti-phishing training one time a year?

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.875
Does that change the likelihood of occurrence?

00:03:06.875 --> 00:03:09.235
Would it change the impact?

00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:13.940
What if I said that a company that you previously worked for got phished

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:17.720
a single time but that resulted in ransomware being

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.905
placed on every computer and caused the company to go bankrupt?

00:03:21.905 --> 00:03:24.245
Does that mean that in your mind,

00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:27.660
this phishing example is critical?
