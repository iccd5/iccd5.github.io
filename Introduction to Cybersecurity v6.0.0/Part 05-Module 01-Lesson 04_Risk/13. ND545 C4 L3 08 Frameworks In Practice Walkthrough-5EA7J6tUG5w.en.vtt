00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
It's imperative at this stage that we step away from talking

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.960
specifically about security risk management for just a moment,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.575
and think about the overall risk management context.

00:00:10.575 --> 00:00:13.920
Many organizations rely on what's described as

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.565
the three lines of defense model for managing risk.

00:00:17.565 --> 00:00:21.150
Even if that's not formally, even if they don't know it.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.990
The three lines of defense model really consists of control or risk owners;

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.955
these are the system owners,

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:33.710
or the individuals that are actually responsible for addressing the risk.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.565
Then we have risk managers;

00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:40.700
these are the internal risk assessors who identify risk and perform risk assessment.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.840
This is primarily where we're focusing our time,

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.109
this is where the GRC role would fit as part of this process.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:51.490
Then finally, you have internal audit;

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.140
they're the folks that provide oversight over

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.334
the entire risk management process and the outcomes.

00:00:57.334 --> 00:01:03.020
As I said, most organizations have some version of this structure in place already.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.665
At a high level, the risk management frameworks we discussed

00:01:06.665 --> 00:01:11.240
earlier tend to operate at the second and third lines of defense,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.555
being used as mechanisms to guide risk management,

00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:17.395
the structure, and the process.

00:01:17.395 --> 00:01:22.700
The first line of defense really being more concerned by the operation

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.860
of business processes and then the implementation of risk mitigating controls.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.945
The bridge between our second line of defense and our first line are risk assessments.

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:35.675
Now, if you're tracking this against the nist RMS,

00:01:35.675 --> 00:01:38.450
this would roughly relate to task R1;

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.020
this is where we're rooting out our risks.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.480
Risk assessments are performed by risk managers like

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:48.860
GRC professionals measuring systems against potential risk.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.670
The risks being the risk statements that we talked about much earlier.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.090
The risk assessments themselves operate by placing

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.695
a risk statement in the context of a particular business process,

00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:06.740
a system, or an organization.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.030
Then making an informed decision about the likelihood and the impact of the risk.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.710
Weighing any additional controls that might actually help reduce that risk,

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.060
and then finally, creating a residual risk rating.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.295
For instance, let's look at an example of antivirus software.

00:02:28.295 --> 00:02:34.265
We have a risk statement that anti-virus systems are not updated,

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:37.070
which may allow access to sensitive data.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:41.405
During our assessment, we find that antivirus software

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:45.775
isn't installed on a number of servers that contain highly sensitive information.

00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:51.020
Our job is to assess how likely it is that risk could be exploited,

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.070
what the impact might be,

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.885
and then finally reached an overall risk score.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:01.370
Remember that risk is equal to the likelihood times impact,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.215
so in this case,

00:03:03.215 --> 00:03:06.570
we've concluded that the risk is high.
