00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
There are two keys to understanding how to build a risk mitigation plan in this scenario.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.450
The first is understanding that while patches are considered critical,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.140
that does not necessarily translate to critical risks.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:19.905
In fact, you assess the likelihood of exploitation as medium and the impact is high.

00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:23.085
Now we didn't talk about mitigating controls.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.815
So we may still need to better understand if there are

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.980
other factors at play that might reduce risk.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.160
Regardless, building a risk mitigation plan

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.070
probably starts in this case with discussing with

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.460
the control owner the most appropriate way and how to implement critical patches.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.840
But we do have one other key element.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.905
We also know that patch management policies aren't being followed.

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:53.140
This is probably another conversation with control owners,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.520
but here you have some additional options.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.960
You may need to work with your governance team to make sure that

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.050
they are measuring the effectiveness of the policy control.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.630
Or you may simply need to

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.740
reinforce the need to follow the patch management policy more closely.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.445
The point is that defining mitigation plans

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:18.060
involves input from control owners, and other stakeholders.
