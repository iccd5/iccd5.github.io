00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
I'd like to start talking about

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.810
Risk Management Frameworks with a National Institute of Standards and Technology,

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.140
Risk Management Framework, or the NIST, RMF.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.630
We'll start here, because I think it represents some of

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.525
the best practices associated with risk management.

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:21.960
But at the same time goes well beyond what I think of as the risk management function,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.615
and actually, bleeds into other governance risk and compliance roles.

00:00:25.615 --> 00:00:30.980
For context, NIST developed this framework to be used by federal systems and

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.290
contractors in an attempt to have

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.430
consistent classification of controls across many systems.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:39.140
If you look at the graphic,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.960
there are number of steps defined in the middle with

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.720
corresponding guidance documentation defined on the exterior rings.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.685
Combined all of this information is quite large,

00:00:50.685 --> 00:00:53.125
so federal agencies and contractors,

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:57.140
often have individuals dedicated to federal compliance,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.280
but I'd like to look at a few of the key aspects.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.315
Let's start at categorizing information in systems and selecting controls.

00:01:05.315 --> 00:01:08.750
System categorization refers to placing

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.305
information or systems into predefined categories;

00:01:12.305 --> 00:01:14.105
low, medium, or high.

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:18.605
With each category designed to be reflective of the overall impact

00:01:18.605 --> 00:01:24.470
that system or information might have on the organization or individuals.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.980
In other organizations, we refer to these things as business impact analysis.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.720
We then select controls appropriate for

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.570
the level of categorization and those controls are

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.850
contained in the various policy documents

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.785
reflected in that risk management framework diagram.

00:01:41.785 --> 00:01:44.190
Let's look at how that operates.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.064
Special publication 800-63-3, which is digital identity guidelines,

00:01:51.064 --> 00:01:56.510
provides an overview of working with digital identities and authentication methods.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:02.405
Now, that document refers to special publication 800-63a,

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:08.390
which set standards for how system users are allowed to prove their identity based

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:09.680
on the system or

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:15.355
information classification we discussed in the categorization step earlier.

00:02:15.355 --> 00:02:17.640
Based on the classification,

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.120
system owners chooses specific identity assurance level,

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.725
either 1, 2 or 3,

00:02:24.725 --> 00:02:27.640
with one being the least stringent.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.580
From there, we can refer to 800-63b to understand

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.850
which corresponding authenticator assurance levels should

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.670
be used and what that means in terms of specific controls.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.555
If you're looking at passwords for instance,

00:02:43.555 --> 00:02:48.480
they're permitted under AAO1 and 2,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.035
but all of those passwords must be at least eight characters in length.

00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:55.225
You can probably tell from this,

00:02:55.225 --> 00:02:57.580
it can be a really complex system.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.634
But I also want to point out that here's an example of where I believe the RMF,

00:03:02.634 --> 00:03:04.985
it goes well beyond risk management.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:10.205
All of the work that I just described is typically reserved for compliance professionals.

00:03:10.205 --> 00:03:15.550
They are generally responsible for ensuring that controls meet specific standards.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.595
Now, let's talk about the implement and assess steps.

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:22.055
Once you've selected controls,

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:24.430
you obviously need to implement them.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.610
That's really a job for our operational security counterparts.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.010
Once complete, our next step is assessing them.

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.740
Here's another area where the RMF goes beyond simple risk-management.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.000
Assessing controls, as we discussed earlier,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.735
is traditionally the role of a Governance Professional.

00:03:44.735 --> 00:03:48.050
But then this risk management framework is not

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.054
necessarily designed to serve as a playbook for risk management activities,

00:03:52.054 --> 00:03:54.965
it's really designed to reduce risk.

00:03:54.965 --> 00:03:58.010
In that way it operates to support a number of

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.184
GRC activities and makes reference to risk management standards where necessary.

00:04:03.184 --> 00:04:05.210
The last component of

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:08.705
the risk management framework that we'll discuss is system authorization.

00:04:08.705 --> 00:04:09.950
This is why I like to think,

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:12.350
that the real risk management work happens,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.400
this is work that's traditionally done by risk managers.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.600
Here's where the target system is authorized to operate by

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.740
considering the totality of security controls implemented throughout the NIST,

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.520
risk management framework process and the residual risk

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.450
the system creates for the organization, the government,

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.360
and individuals keeping in mind,

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.630
that the framework was really developed with a goal of creating

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.345
consistent controls and security standards for federal agencies.

00:04:43.345 --> 00:04:50.540
All of the steps for authorization are detailed in NIST special publication 800-37.

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:54.065
I think all of those service are pretty good guide for

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:58.400
understanding the steps that you need to perform in risk management.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:05.420
Task 1, authorization package that roughly equates to identifying risks.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.655
Then you'll analyze the risk,

00:05:07.655 --> 00:05:11.475
under step 2, you will respond to the risk,

00:05:11.475 --> 00:05:12.950
you will treat the risk,

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:16.550
which we'll talk about in just a little while and then finally,

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.920
we'll report the risk to senior leadership.
