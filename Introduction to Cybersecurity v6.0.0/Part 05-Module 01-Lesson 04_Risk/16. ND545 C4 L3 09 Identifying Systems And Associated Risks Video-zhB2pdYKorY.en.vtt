00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.125
Now you know what risk is and what risk assessments are.

00:00:04.125 --> 00:00:05.805
Now what do you assess?

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:09.675
You can literally assess anything in the organization.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:13.274
You can assess existing systems, new systems,

00:00:13.274 --> 00:00:17.610
processes, procedures, really anything you want to look at.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.430
What's important is that you understand

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.360
the scope of what you plan to assess and then clearly define it.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.885
Let's say, for instance, you choose to assess the HR department.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:29.880
What are you really going to look at?

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.665
Is it the whole department?

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:34.035
There's a lot to look at here.

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:39.470
Now, what if you chose instead to assess just the employee onboarding process.

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.630
It's a much smaller scope,

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.330
but we don't know if that meets your needs.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.275
There are a few ways that I think you can start to think about scope.

00:00:48.275 --> 00:00:53.440
First, you really need to decide what you want to assess.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.790
You may already have a target in mind.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.200
Maybe it's a new system,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.990
but you may just want to start assessing areas of

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.185
the business that you believe present some risk.

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:06.800
That's okay too. Next, I like to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.705
understand all the components of the system or the process.

00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:12.625
What does it connect to?

00:01:12.625 --> 00:01:14.755
Where does the data go?

00:01:14.755 --> 00:01:18.430
I try to make sure I have a diagram of the system and where

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.210
the data flow occurs before beginning any assessment.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.520
Finally, I revise the scope if necessary and then really begin to plan

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.765
my assessment based on the scope and the components of the system or process.

00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:35.770
Let's look at identifying appropriate risks.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.855
This is probably the most challenging part of the cyber risk management profession.

00:01:40.855 --> 00:01:44.365
You've already chosen your system, your scope.

00:01:44.365 --> 00:01:47.965
How do you decide what risks to assess?

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:51.970
Now, earlier, we talked about how to create

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.735
risks statements and what risks statements actually are.

00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.540
But how do you know which ones are appropriate for

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.405
that system or that scope that you've chosen?

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:04.910
What's generally a matter of experience,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.520
but there are a few places that you can target.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.025
One of those places is by looking at

00:02:10.025 --> 00:02:14.315
existing compliance standards that have specific control objectives,

00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:16.850
you can look at previous risk assessments

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.500
or prior audits that your organization has performed,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.360
or you can utilize your knowledge of

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.920
cybersecurity to think about risks that are appropriate for your system.
