00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.770
What do you do with risk?

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.130
We've talked about how to identify risk and how to measure it.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.110
But what do you do about it?

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.295
Once you've identified that risk exists, what do you do?

00:00:11.295 --> 00:00:16.395
The whole purpose of risk management is to understand and act on risk.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:19.980
Traditionally, there are five ways to deal with risk.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.660
We call these risk treatment.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.095
The first is acceptance.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:28.750
Accepting the risk without taking any further action.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.600
It's acknowledging that it exists and doing nothing.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.705
The second is modifying the risk.

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:40.885
This is implementing a control that lessens or changes the risk in some way.

00:00:40.885 --> 00:00:42.615
Then there's transfer.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:47.180
In most cases, cybersecurity risk transference means insuring against

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.800
the risk occurring through a cybersecurity insurance policy of some sort.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.525
Or you can create a shared liability model with a vendor.

00:00:56.525 --> 00:00:58.175
Then there's avoidance.

00:00:58.175 --> 00:01:03.580
You can literally choose to avoid the risk by just doing something different altogether.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.970
Then finally, you'll notice that I have capitalize marked in red.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.240
The reason for that is that, capitalizing on risk,

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.980
very much relates to financial and business risk management.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.610
Identifying for instance, a high risk investment and then choosing to attempt to

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.230
capitalize on that risk by investing even more resources is pretty common.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.735
But security DRC is much more focused on the other four risk treatment methods.

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:34.025
Certainly there are times when an organization will accept security risk,

00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:36.590
but there aren't really any examples that come to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.355
mind where it's possible to capitalize on that risk.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:43.660
Now, who decides what that risk treatment is?

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.090
I think it's one of the more interesting components of risk management,

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.570
because it's often a function of the organization's appetite for risk, it's maturity,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.705
and it's maturity in practicing security hygiene,

00:01:56.705 --> 00:02:00.755
it's size, and then collaboration with stakeholders.

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:03.050
Now, depending on the organization,

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:05.105
the controller risk owners,

00:02:05.105 --> 00:02:08.780
may take a large part in deciding the best risk treatment.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:15.545
Other organizations may see most of the risk decision-making to the risk managers.

00:02:15.545 --> 00:02:20.885
Generally taking those recommendations of the risk managers at face value.

00:02:20.885 --> 00:02:26.690
Then others rely on a collective effort really involving stakeholders to either reach

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.020
consensus or present the risk decisions to leadership for a final resolution.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.315
For me, I think that collaborative approach is the most effective.

00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:42.290
Leaving the decision in hands of risk owners potentially put

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.760
security decision-making in the hands of untrained individuals,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.230
and then leaving it in the hands of risk managers can create a situation

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.240
where only a handful of individuals are setting the organization's security strategy.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.240
Now, I mentioned that leadership are sometimes used for final risk resolution.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.610
Even though you may choose to accept a risk or

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.535
modify it in only some slight way for instance,

00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:09.830
those actions have to be recorded.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.220
The reason for that is because sometimes you'll need

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:17.305
senior stakeholders to participate in the decision making.

00:03:17.305 --> 00:03:21.140
You also want to make sure that your decision making aligns with

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.240
your organizational strategy and

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.770
your senior leadership and their involvement can help provide that.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.820
Recording the risk, and then involving management can also

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.945
provide some temporary relief to risk management functions,

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:37.670
meaning that they can help write

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.955
management exceptions that may allow you not to address risk immediately.

00:03:42.955 --> 00:03:46.580
Then finally, recording that risk helps showcase

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.360
that the risk management process in your organization is really mature.
