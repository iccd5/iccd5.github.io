00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
Insider threats are a huge concern in organizations as well.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.950
These are people who have legitimate authorized access within

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.825
the company and use that insider access or knowledge to cause harm.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:16.335
One interesting finding is that 40 percent of

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:20.925
insider threat breaches take over one year to detect.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:24.060
This is usually because insiders are better at

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.705
covering their tracks and evading detection altogether,

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:29.915
and the longer the detection window,

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:32.600
generally, the more expensive the breach.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.350
Now, let's walk through some common insider threat profiles.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.125
First, we have criminal Christie,

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:42.985
who tends to be a financially motivated individual.

00:00:42.985 --> 00:00:45.770
While companies typically try to hire good people,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.000
some are down like criminals and steal from their employers.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
However, it may not start that way;

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.820
situations change, people meet financial hardship and make bad choices.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.200
Either way, internal employees can launch financially motivated crimes,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.410
they can be damaging to companies.

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.175
Then we have oblivious Olga.

00:01:08.175 --> 00:01:11.795
Ninety percent of breaches involve human error,

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:15.715
and people are still the easiest target for attackers.

00:01:15.715 --> 00:01:20.040
People make mistakes, they leave computers unlocked and walk away,

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.180
they write their passwords down on sticky notes,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:29.305
they click on fake money inheritance e-mails from Nigerian princes and much more.

00:01:29.305 --> 00:01:34.115
I still remember one of my very first experiences with this kind of employee.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:37.550
It was a month into my internship and I

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.940
was monitoring our network for any sensitive data like

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.315
credit card numbers or social security numbers that were being sent

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:48.625
out of our network because of course that should not be happening.

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:53.225
I came across this file one day that an employee was sending

00:01:53.225 --> 00:01:57.650
from their work e-mail to their personal Yahoo account every month,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.800
and it had all kinds of sensitive information in it that should not be sent in e-mail.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.990
Any hacker that got their hands on this file would

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.100
have a field day launching easy attacks.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.055
When I talked to the employee and investigated to learn more,

00:02:13.055 --> 00:02:18.454
I found that they simply did not know the risks associated with their actions.

00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:24.170
That's very common, and so these naive employees are a threat to watch out for.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.630
Next, we have third-party Terry.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.675
Insiders aren't just employees of the company,

00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:36.275
many breaches stem from third-parties and contractors working with the company.

00:02:36.275 --> 00:02:41.300
For example, in one of the most talked about data breaches of the century,

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.255
the target data breach in 2013,

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:47.300
it started when a third-party employee from

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.210
the company's air conditioning vendor clicked on

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:53.330
a phishing link that helped the attackers get from

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.670
the HVAC vendors network and eventually hop over the targets network.

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.945
Millions of records were lost and millions of dollars spent recovering.

00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:05.780
That event shed light on how it's not

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.675
just your own employees that you need to worry about,

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:11.105
but the third parties matter as well.

00:03:11.105 --> 00:03:16.985
This is also a case where while the insider did not have malicious intentions,

00:03:16.985 --> 00:03:21.880
this mishap resulted in considerable damage to the company.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.255
On to disgruntled Derrick.

00:03:24.255 --> 00:03:27.140
This is the employee that didn't get the raise they

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.320
want or didn't get the performance review they wanted,

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.515
and now they're motivated by retaliation and revenge,

00:03:34.515 --> 00:03:38.680
and so they sabotage or lash out against the company.

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.300
Finally, we have terminated Trevor.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.860
Employees can pose a threat to companies after

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.780
they are gone if access is not properly removed.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.950
Eighty percent of companies, say employees,

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.565
still have some form of access even after leaving the company.

00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:02.000
This data can be sold or shared with competitors.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.570
The bottom line is that insider threat motivations and

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.319
capabilities have some similarities with external attackers,

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:12.085
but there are also unique motivations.

00:04:12.085 --> 00:04:15.860
They can also be harder to identify since these people tend to

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:20.240
have authorized access and internal knowledge of systems,

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:23.670
this is a critical threat to keep in mind.
