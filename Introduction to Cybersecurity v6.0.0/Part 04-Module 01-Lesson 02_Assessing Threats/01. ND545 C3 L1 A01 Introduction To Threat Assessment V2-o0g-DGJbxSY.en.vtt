00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.175
Threat assessment is a fundamental part of the cyber security risk management process,

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:09.045
and I want to start with a quote that truly drives this point.

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:10.845
In The Art of War,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:15.510
Sun Tzu shared an infamous quote that still rings true today.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.750
A key point made here is that if you don't know yourself and you don't know your enemy,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.695
you will lose every battle.

00:00:22.695 --> 00:00:25.330
Now this doesn't just apply to physical wars.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.110
In order to overcome cyber battles in defend against cyber attacks,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.015
you have essentially know two things,

00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:34.540
yourself and your enemy.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.730
What this means in practice is that you have to

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.375
know the ins and outs of the company you are trying to protect.

00:00:41.375 --> 00:00:44.254
Be familiar with the technology environment,

00:00:44.254 --> 00:00:46.475
the people, the processes,

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:49.730
and all of the assets that make the company run,

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.340
and then by the phrase know your enemy,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.450
it means that you also need to know the threats you face.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.915
Who is out to get you and why?

00:00:57.915 --> 00:00:59.600
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.330
you'll be able to explain the relationship between threats,

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.530
threat actors, vulnerabilities, and exploits,

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:12.695
you'll be able to utilize event contexts to identify potential threat actor motivations,

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:15.140
you'll be able to identify security threats

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.350
applicable to important organizational assets,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.250
and you'll also learn to use standard frameworks to assess threats,

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.970
identify risks, and prioritize assets. Now let's get to it.
