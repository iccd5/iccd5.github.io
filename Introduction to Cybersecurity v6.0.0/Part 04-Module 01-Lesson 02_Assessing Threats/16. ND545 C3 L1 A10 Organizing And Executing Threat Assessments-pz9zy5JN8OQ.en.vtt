00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.635
The threat assessment life cycle can be summarized in three phases;

00:00:04.635 --> 00:00:08.025
you must identify, analyze,

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:11.910
and prioritize threats on an ongoing basis.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.695
The identification stage includes using everything you know

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:21.915
about your environment and company in order to start identifying potential threats.

00:00:21.915 --> 00:00:26.250
This is a combination of brainstorming and also using

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.515
available resources to discover threats both proactively and reactively.

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:35.030
For example, threat detection software and tools

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.245
exist such as endpoint detection and response solutions,

00:00:39.245 --> 00:00:41.095
also known as EDR.

00:00:41.095 --> 00:00:43.895
These can help companies identify threats.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.395
One advanced method is to use threat hunting.

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:51.845
That's a process in which you proactively comb through networks to find

00:00:51.845 --> 00:00:58.200
advanced and undetected threats that may bypass typical detection technology.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.525
Finally, you want to think about the threat actors we've discussed,

00:01:03.525 --> 00:01:07.945
their motivations, and how they might be relevant to a business.

00:01:07.945 --> 00:01:09.980
During the analyze phase,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.915
you want to gather as much detail and information about the threats you've identified.

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:17.705
Many resources can help here as well.

00:01:17.705 --> 00:01:22.145
For example, Google is a great place to start to learn about a threat.

00:01:22.145 --> 00:01:25.475
You can also leverage intelligence sharing groups,

00:01:25.475 --> 00:01:28.730
the FBI, and dark web searching.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.910
You can even find a ton of information about threat

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.410
actors through social media and blogs.

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.275
There are also threat intelligence technology platforms

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:42.770
that aggregate and interpret mass amounts of

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.890
threat data from different sources to provide

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.695
the necessary context for decision-making and threat assessment.

00:01:50.695 --> 00:01:56.620
Then the goal of gathering all of this information is to start building threat scenarios,

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.460
threat profiles, and threat models that can

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.180
paint a more clear picture of threats relevant to the company.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.140
The final step is to prioritize the threats.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.330
Here, you take into account the variables that matter to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.875
the company in order to determine what the greatest concerns are.

00:02:17.875 --> 00:02:20.815
A company may take into account, for example,

00:02:20.815 --> 00:02:25.150
the likelihood that the threat would actually impact them,

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.980
what that impact would be,

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.015
and what controls are in place to protect against that impact.

00:02:31.015 --> 00:02:34.820
One thing to note here is that while the task of

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.055
threat intelligence is listed under the analyze phase in the overarching framework,

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:42.890
because that's where it's probably leveraged the most.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.545
Threat intelligence also plays a huge role in identifying and prioritizing risks as well.

00:02:48.545 --> 00:02:54.329
It applies across the board and the life cycle is a never ending process.
