00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.155
We've talked about how once a thread is identified,

00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.300
then threat scenarios, models,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.845
and profiles can be built to better understand and assess the threat.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:12.825
To provide an example,

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:17.025
we're going to walk through how to create a threat profile.

00:00:17.025 --> 00:00:19.860
While there are many approaches to doing this,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.970
standard frameworks are a common starting point in companies.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.360
MITRE Cyber Prep Framework is an example

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.794
that focuses on three key traits for threat profiling.

00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:34.110
The intention of the threat actor,

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.760
the target, and the capability.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.865
Intent considers questions like,

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:44.450
what's the ultimate goal of the threat actor and

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.520
what is the consequence that will result if they are successful?

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.160
This also considers the time-frame.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.860
Do they intend to come in very quickly, do damage and leave?

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.015
Or are they operating in stealth or persistent mode?

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.945
Which means they're in it for the long call.

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:04.460
They are trying to stick around your environment and

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.294
learn quietly over time before striking.

00:01:07.294 --> 00:01:10.430
This timing is important to consider.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.490
If you think about a major bank heist, for example,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.530
the mastermind may spend months or years planning the attacks,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.825
learning where the cameras are,

00:01:20.825 --> 00:01:24.140
knowing who will be on staff and what their weaknesses

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.615
are before actually conducting the robbery.

00:01:27.615 --> 00:01:30.960
The same is the case in cyber-security.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.090
An attacker can sit quietly in a network for years without being

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.090
detected as they plan a major attack or steal things slowly.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.180
The next part is to understand the target of the attack.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.949
Is it a certain system,

00:01:45.949 --> 00:01:48.575
network, product, or a person?

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:52.280
Also note, that an organization can be attacked as

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.665
a stepping stone in an attack on one of its partners or customers.

00:01:57.665 --> 00:01:59.810
Businesses also have to take into

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.145
consideration whether they are actually the intended target.

00:02:04.145 --> 00:02:07.070
These are things that threat intelligence and research

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.100
on threat actors can help you understand.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.155
Finally, you need to know what the threat actor's capabilities are.

00:02:15.155 --> 00:02:20.630
What resources and methods do they have available to carry out an attack?

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.255
If a threat actor has all of these big intentions and dreams of attacks,

00:02:26.255 --> 00:02:31.790
but you find it's a teen operating as a script kiddie on a college budget,

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.560
it's not to say they couldn't get funding from somewhere or be successful.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.530
But you may consider the threat differently than you would a government backed

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.115
nation state actor with a multi-million dollar budget

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:50.645
and an army of attackers available to carry out on their mission.

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:54.815
During this section, you can explore and document

00:02:54.815 --> 00:03:00.265
what attack patterns and methods the attacker has typically use as well.

00:03:00.265 --> 00:03:04.160
Another free resource from MITRE I recommend you explore

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.420
is the group section tied to the MITRE attack framework.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.010
We'll walk through that framework in greater detail later.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.700
But in that group section,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.765
they aggregate tons of intelligence information on known threat actors,

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:20.435
including what their goals and motivations are,

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:23.360
their typical attack methods and more and you can

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.240
use this information to add to your threat profile.
