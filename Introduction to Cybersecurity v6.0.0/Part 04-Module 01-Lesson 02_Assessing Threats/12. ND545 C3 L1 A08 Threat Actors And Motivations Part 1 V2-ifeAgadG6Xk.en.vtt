00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
It's important to understand common threat actors and their motivations.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.295
This is a critical step in knowing your enemy.

00:00:08.295 --> 00:00:13.860
cyber criminals are financially motivated attackers looking for a payday.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.575
Fraud related attacks are an example,

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:20.550
and the impact is usually a financial loss to the company.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.795
Hacktivists are a form of activists that

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:29.190
leverage hacks to advance political or social causes.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.545
In this case, for example,

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:34.035
a group supporting Peter may hack

00:00:34.035 --> 00:00:38.910
a fur coat manufacturer to disrupt the production of fur coats.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.845
Next, nation-state actors seek to sabotage military or critical infrastructure.

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:50.755
They may engage in espionage or enable cyber warfare.

00:00:50.755 --> 00:00:54.679
Script kiddies are inexperienced hackers

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.675
who use pre-packaged attacks for various reasons.

00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:03.485
These days it's easy to purchase a hack kit, For example,

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:09.545
a ransomware attack kit can be purchased on the dark web for less than $50,

00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:14.225
while the average payout for an attack in several $1000.

00:01:14.225 --> 00:01:18.440
So you can even get different ransomware as a service packages,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.400
with customer service support when you're launching your own attack.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.485
Finally, cyber terrorists use violent and debilitating means

00:01:27.485 --> 00:01:33.650
to further ideological goals stemming from domestic influences that could be political,

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.425
religious, social, racial, or environmental in nature.

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:43.819
Each of these attacks will target organizations for different reasons,

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.260
and that context is important to have as you prepare to assess the threat.
