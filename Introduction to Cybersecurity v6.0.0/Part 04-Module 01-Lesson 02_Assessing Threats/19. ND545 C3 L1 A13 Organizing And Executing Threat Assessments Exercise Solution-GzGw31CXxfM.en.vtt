00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
In this exercise, you've just received

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:07.340
new threat intelligence that Holly is associated with a group called Leviathan.

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:09.810
You're using this along with information from

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.725
previous exercises to create a Mac threat profile.

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:18.090
Now with everything you know from those exercises and this new tip,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.870
you can start pulling together a threat profile.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:24.885
If we focus on the intentional threat in this case, Holly,

00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:30.480
you'd want to think through each element of the cyber prep framework with her in mind.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.555
The first thing you should do is research the group Leviathan.

00:00:34.555 --> 00:00:37.970
You'll find tons of information that can help you populate

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.600
the threat profile along with what you already know.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.380
The MITRE ATT&amp;CK group's site is a great resource for that.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.970
If you haven't looked at it already,

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.285
take a quick look there as a starting point.

00:00:49.285 --> 00:00:52.439
Now, when it comes to intent,

00:00:52.439 --> 00:00:55.380
Holly's goal appears to be fraud or theft.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.045
However, when you look into Leviathan you learn it's an espionage group.

00:01:00.045 --> 00:01:04.445
So she may be up to something else on behalf of the organization.

00:01:04.445 --> 00:01:08.435
The consequences in this case could be financial impact or

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:12.980
loss of intellectual property if the attack is successful, but there could be more.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:17.120
There could be reputation impact if it gets publicized, for example.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.895
Also if Holly is stealing login credentials,

00:01:19.895 --> 00:01:24.020
she maybe trying to log in and out of the systems over time.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.620
Again, based on the image and the Intel you have,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.500
there may not be a definitive answer for everything,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.090
but you can start to hypothesize and do the research.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.939
Now regarding targets, since the threat group she's associated

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.455
with seems to have a greater Maritime related mission.

00:01:42.455 --> 00:01:46.640
It's worth exploring if you have any partners or vendors,

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.530
they may use you as a stepping stone to target.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.825
Lastly, when it comes to capabilities,

00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:56.915
you can include from looking into the threat group.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:00.215
They are state-sponsored and backed by China.

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.490
So they may have tons of resources at their disposal.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.219
The common attack tactics include spear phishing,

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.940
backdoors, credential theft, and more.

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.300
The bottom line here to remember is that when threat profiling,

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.835
again, you may not have all the answers and that's okay.

00:02:16.835 --> 00:02:18.010
That's the reality.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.025
You gather as much information as you can to drive your decisions.

00:02:22.025 --> 00:02:25.805
A bottom line to remember is that when threat profiling,

00:02:25.805 --> 00:02:29.210
you may not have all of the answers and that's okay.

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.995
That's the reality.

00:02:30.995 --> 00:02:36.540
Gather as much information as you can to help drive your decisions.
