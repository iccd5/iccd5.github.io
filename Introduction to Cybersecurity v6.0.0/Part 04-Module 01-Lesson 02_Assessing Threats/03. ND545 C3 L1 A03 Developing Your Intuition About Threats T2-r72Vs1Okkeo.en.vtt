00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
As human beings, we naturally assess threats every single day.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.720
Let's say you're near the shore at a beach and you come across a snake,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.795
a bee, and a jellyfish.

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:16.380
Now, you may consider these threats as each of them can harm you.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.170
But which threat should you care about the most?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.330
Which poses the greatest risk?

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.295
You would start to take into consideration several different factors,

00:00:25.295 --> 00:00:28.715
like what's the worst outcome if each attacks you?

00:00:28.715 --> 00:00:31.265
Now, if you get stung by a bee,

00:00:31.265 --> 00:00:35.170
is that worse than being bitten by a snake?

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.480
What if you learned that the snake is actually not venomous,

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:40.990
but you are allergic to bee stings?

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:42.825
Does that make a difference?

00:00:42.825 --> 00:00:46.160
So here are some things that you want to consider.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.675
Which threat should you be most concerned about?

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:52.035
How can you mitigate the risk?

00:00:52.035 --> 00:00:54.575
For example, by staying out of the water,

00:00:54.575 --> 00:00:57.680
you avoid the threat of the jellyfish altogether.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.480
This is threat assessment.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.800
You do it every day.
