00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
You've officially made it through the first lesson.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.970
Threat assessment is a fundamental part of the cybersecurity risk management process

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.925
and understanding this brings you one step closer to

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:15.405
unleashing your potential as a cybersecurity practitioner.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:18.795
You have to be familiar with the technology environment,

00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:21.120
the people, the processes,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.040
and all of the assets that make the company run.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.340
You also need to know about the possible threats that you face that could disrupt that.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.450
At this point, you've learned about the relationship between threats,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.645
threat actors, vulnerabilities, and exploits.

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:39.454
You've explored how to utilize event context

00:00:39.454 --> 00:00:42.560
to identify potential threat actor motivations.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.800
You should be able to identify security threats that

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.420
are applicable to important organizational assets.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.410
Finally, you've learned how to use standard frameworks like Cyber Prep to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:00.899
assess threats that can help you identify risks and prioritize your protection efforts.
