00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.190
For this part of the exercise,

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.429
you're analyzing the threat scenario image and describing

00:00:05.429 --> 00:00:09.030
the type of threats and potential attacks at hand.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.610
In this case, there are both intentional and unintentional threats present.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.800
The hacker has clearly done research and intends to target the user with malware,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.010
making Holly, an intentional threat.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.125
Mary, on the other hand,

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:26.850
is an unintentional threat.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.490
While she isn't trying to expose the company to

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.790
issues by clicking on the phishing e-mail, she has.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.430
Also, in terms of attack types,

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.370
there's a combination of human-based and technology-based attacks happening here.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.810
The attack includes social engineering tactics,

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:47.140
namely a phishing attack.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.639
But if you focus even more closely,

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:51.710
it's not just the phishing attack,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.805
it's considered spear phishing because the email was highly targeted at one person.

00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:01.189
Since that person is a senior executive,

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:04.700
it can be further labeled as a whaling attack.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.990
Also, the attack involves malware discovered today,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.260
which means a zero-day attack is at play.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.979
As you deal with threat scenarios and incidence in practice,

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:22.500
it's important to be able to analyze situations like these to extract relevant insights.
