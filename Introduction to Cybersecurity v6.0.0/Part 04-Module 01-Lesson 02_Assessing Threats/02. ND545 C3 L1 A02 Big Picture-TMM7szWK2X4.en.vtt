00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.875
Cyber security is ultimately about risk management.

00:00:03.875 --> 00:00:06.860
The number of threats and issues that exist are

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:10.470
endless and we all know that no matter how hard we try,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.170
we cannot protect against every single threat.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.600
We have to thoughtfully pick and choose the ones that matter the most.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.010
A standard risk management process involves identifying,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.889
assessing, and mitigating risks.

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:28.935
During that first step of identifying risks,

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:31.605
a key component of that is understanding

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:34.835
the threats the company faces because without a threat,

00:00:34.835 --> 00:00:36.590
essentially there is no risk.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.535
Whether it's different cyber attack methods, threat actors,

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:45.350
or unintentional threats, you have to understand what those threats are,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.785
who's behind them, and what their motivations are.

00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:52.850
All of that insight provides the basis for knowing what

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.750
you are up against in order to ultimately plan the best defense.
