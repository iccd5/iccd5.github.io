00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
In this exercise, the goal is to

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.795
analyze the threat scenario image and identify the asset,

00:00:06.795 --> 00:00:10.695
the threat, the vulnerability, and the exploit.

00:00:10.695 --> 00:00:14.100
The ultimate threat is that the attacker might

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.775
breach security and steal from the organization.

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.375
The main vulnerability in this case is that

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:26.460
the unpatched software which the attacker can aim to exploit is present.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.470
As we progress through lessons,

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.975
you'll also learn that the employees ignorance is also a threat to security.

00:00:33.975 --> 00:00:36.495
The assets involved may vary.

00:00:36.495 --> 00:00:40.880
However, you can begin to hypothesize about what the target might be.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.960
Remember, assets are anything of value to the company.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.060
In this case, the asset could be the victim's computer and the data on it,

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.140
it could be the financial system the attacker is looking to gain access to,

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.930
it could be a lot of things.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.135
Finally, because the attacker is taking advantage of malware that was discovered today,

00:01:02.135 --> 00:01:05.990
you can infer that a zero-day exploit is being used.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.850
The attacker is also exploiting

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.945
the naive and curious nature of human beings through social engineering,

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:14.730
which we'll talk about more later as well.
