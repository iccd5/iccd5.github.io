00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
Our last governance function,

00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:03.900
is Policy and Procedure Management.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.365
Policies are often written by governance professionals, and earlier we said,

00:00:08.365 --> 00:00:12.210
that part of the reason for that is that much of the decision-making from

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.700
our information security steering committees wind up a security policy.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:22.770
In that way, security policies become lists of organizational controls.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.230
They set direction by expressing what leadership has decided or

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.660
appropriate security controls or inappropriate employee behaviors.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.060
To be effective, they are almost always determinative,

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:41.555
meaning that they use forceful binary language to avoid ambiguity.

00:00:41.555 --> 00:00:46.890
Words like must, must not, shall, and others.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.000
Because these documents dictate what the organization and its employees must do,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.800
and users are trained to be aware of their content,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.295
they operate as controls themselves.

00:00:57.295 --> 00:01:00.455
While policies dictate organizational behaviors,

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:06.205
procedures dictate specific behaviors but exist to support policy.

00:01:06.205 --> 00:01:11.195
When a policy dictates something that must occur or will occur,

00:01:11.195 --> 00:01:13.910
the procedure is there to make sure that those

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:17.930
responsible perform that action in a uniform way.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.985
In that way procedures are tactical,

00:01:20.985 --> 00:01:26.000
they provide detailed line by line instructions about how to accomplish a task,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.595
and of course, since they ensure that those tasks were completed,

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:33.165
they also operate as controls.

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:36.950
Now, policies often get conflated with procedures.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.780
One of the reasons for that,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.915
is that folks try to make policies overly detailed,

00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.695
the detail should be in the procedure.

00:01:44.695 --> 00:01:46.880
Let's look at a couple of examples.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.630
If our policy is to cook a different meal everyday,

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.345
our procedure is today's recipe,

00:01:54.345 --> 00:01:59.874
or you might have a policy requiring users to report security incidents,

00:01:59.874 --> 00:02:02.340
how to report them is the procedure.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.070
Now, notice in this procedure,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.140
we actually have some passive language.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.585
It says, that users should contact IT security by,

00:02:11.585 --> 00:02:13.775
and then it gives them a couple of options.

00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:19.460
Passive language is okay in both policies and procedures,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.525
but it should only be used when you're providing users with choices.

00:02:23.525 --> 00:02:26.720
If your intention is to require users to do something,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.330
you have to use determinative language.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.910
Let's look at another example.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.125
When you're writing or assessing a policy,

00:02:33.125 --> 00:02:36.515
it should be looking for four things immediately.

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:38.165
Is it clear on purpose?

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:41.935
Meaning does the policy have a clear and definitive purpose,

00:02:41.935 --> 00:02:43.950
so when an employee picks it up,

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.610
will they know exactly why the policy exists.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.125
Is it clear on scope,

00:02:48.125 --> 00:02:52.025
will that same employee be able to tell exactly what the policy applies to?

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:53.240
Is it every employee?

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.605
Is it every computer system or is it only some of them?

00:02:56.605 --> 00:02:59.525
Policies should never be tactical.

00:02:59.525 --> 00:03:03.319
If you're reading a policy and it describes an entire process,

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:05.030
that process should, generally,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.195
be moved to a procedure document.

00:03:07.195 --> 00:03:09.620
Policies are meant to be concise,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.305
explaining what is permitted or not.

00:03:12.305 --> 00:03:16.565
Procedures represent how something should, actually, be accomplished.

00:03:16.565 --> 00:03:20.150
Finally, policies in particular should use

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.580
determinative language to make it clear that the defined behavior is a requirement.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.485
There are some occasions when you may use passive language,

00:03:29.485 --> 00:03:33.425
but it is nearly always followed by some determinative action.

00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:37.280
Here, the user has a choice to bring their own mobile device,

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.560
but if they exercise that choice,

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.250
they must follow additional guidelines.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.555
Now, let's walk through just a few more examples.

00:03:45.555 --> 00:03:49.280
In this instance, the purpose of the policy serves

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.700
to guide the organization in protection of the confidentiality,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.560
integrity, and availability of information and technology assets,

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.905
but then the purpose goes on to describe other actions.

00:04:00.905 --> 00:04:03.625
Typically, we'd want to remove that.

00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:07.820
The policy also talks about security incident reporting and it says that,

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.165
"Users may contact the Information Security Department

00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:13.570
if their laptop is lost or stolen."

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.705
That language isn't determinative,

00:04:15.705 --> 00:04:17.189
and as we've discussed,

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.515
in policies, you want to use determinative language.

00:04:20.515 --> 00:04:24.475
It should say, "users must or users shall".

00:04:24.475 --> 00:04:27.660
Then finally, firewall monitoring, it says that,

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.890
"Firewall logs will be reviewed one time every quarter

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:35.435
by," and then it provides a rather lengthy explanation how to do that.

00:04:35.435 --> 00:04:39.780
This is language best saved for procedure.
