00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.385
Let's go back and talk influence.

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:05.130
We'll spend some time on one way that

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.570
governance professionals are expected to influence organizational strategy.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.780
They may take part in or actually

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.175
lead what we call an information security steering committee.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:20.940
These committees in many organizations are used

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.790
to ensure that security goals align with business objectives.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.070
They do this by fostering an open dialogue

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.275
between operational stakeholders and security leadership.

00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:35.165
Now why the governance role specifically?

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:39.845
We tend to think of this as part of security governance for two reasons.

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:42.350
First, because of the role that they play

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.990
in communicating with the organization at large.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.380
Remember, they develop and manage policies and

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.390
procedures and then communicate them to the organization.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.545
Additionally, that development and delivery of end-user security training.

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:00.980
Not to mention that much of the security steering committee's

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.990
decision-making actually ends up as security policy.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:10.190
Then second, governance professionals tend to have a well-rounded understanding of

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.800
the organization security posture because of

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.120
the work that they do, measuring control effectiveness.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.195
Behind the closed doors of the security steering committee meeting,

00:01:20.195 --> 00:01:24.050
what is really happening is a transfer of information.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.570
The business provides strategic information to security stakeholders so that GRC

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:35.015
and operational security goals can be set in a way that supports that strategy.

00:01:35.015 --> 00:01:39.305
I can't stress enough how important steering committees are,

00:01:39.305 --> 00:01:41.225
or at least something like them.

00:01:41.225 --> 00:01:45.020
I've spent the better part of my career working to break down silos and

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.925
organizations that exist between the security and business organizations,

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:51.950
between security and legal,

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.810
and between security and operations.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.360
For me, it's always been

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.315
that security steering committee that provides the platform to do just that.

00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:03.770
The committee builds the bridge,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.310
but it's up to you as the security professionals to use

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.865
that opportunity to build trust and act in support of the business,

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:18.820
use security mechanisms, and work toward solutions that can be supported.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.695
IT operations and cybersecurity don't

00:02:21.695 --> 00:02:25.265
exist without the products and services of the business.

00:02:25.265 --> 00:02:28.160
The committee facilitates conversation,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.640
but you have to always remember that

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.365
security exist to be a support system rather than an encumbrance.

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:40.040
Too often, security can think of itself as

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.800
a gate and they make decisions in a vacuum about whether something is or is not secure.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.360
The steering committee is your place to voice your opinion.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.420
But effective alignment of security goals means working to help create solutions.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.960
Let me give you an example. Imagine that your company has spent

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.490
the last six months secretly developing a new product.

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.100
As part of the product launch,

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:07.925
they've also created a brand new web presence.

00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:09.815
That was all very hush, hush.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.995
So secret that they actually hired

00:03:12.995 --> 00:03:17.975
outside contractors to develop the website that promotes the product.

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:20.810
Now it's two weeks before the launch and you're sitting

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.780
down to an information security steering committee meeting.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.730
In fact, it's

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.920
the first ever information security steering committee meeting at your organization.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.000
One of the senior business leaders leans over and says, "Hey, listen.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.300
Just FYI, we do have this new product

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:41.770
and this website that we're about to launch, just FYI."

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:43.785
To make a long story short,

00:03:43.785 --> 00:03:46.220
you convince the business leaders that you

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.985
really should test the website before it goes live.

00:03:48.985 --> 00:03:53.975
Lo and behold, you discover that it has critical flaws.

00:03:53.975 --> 00:03:57.049
Flaws that could result in data loss,

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.274
credit card theft, public embarrassment,

00:04:00.274 --> 00:04:03.830
you name it, it's got it. What do you do?

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.785
Do you tell the company to delay the launch?

00:04:06.785 --> 00:04:12.545
Now that is probably a great way to never have another steering committee meeting.

00:04:12.545 --> 00:04:17.300
Obviously, the mistake here is that the dialog should have been created a long time ago.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.330
But now you're in a position which probably best to help find an answer that does both,

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.415
it works to keep the company safe and it enables the product launch.

00:04:28.415 --> 00:04:30.125
As you build trust,

00:04:30.125 --> 00:04:33.425
more information will be exposed in these meetings.

00:04:33.425 --> 00:04:36.680
We've talked a really good amount about using

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.935
steering committees to align business and security goals.

00:04:39.935 --> 00:04:42.680
Mostly we've discussed them in the context of

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:46.000
the business providing information to security leadership.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.085
You want to align goals, and in this way,

00:04:49.085 --> 00:04:53.150
these committee meetings can be a time when confidential information is

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.665
shared between stakeholders to produce better outcomes.

00:04:57.665 --> 00:05:03.530
But these meetings can also be used to develop a two-way conversation.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.920
They can also be used as a time for senior leaders

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.445
to provide oversight and security activities,

00:05:10.445 --> 00:05:12.915
set or approve security policy,

00:05:12.915 --> 00:05:16.325
or be a place for you to provide updates on

00:05:16.325 --> 00:05:21.005
overall security posture or discuss new and emerging threats with senior leadership.

00:05:21.005 --> 00:05:24.790
The idea is simply to promote effective communication.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.160
But effective also means being selective.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:34.730
Membership should be kept relatively low with only a handful or so of key stakeholders.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:37.760
Every one of those members should be in a position

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.730
to influence and also be strategic thinkers.
