If I were asked to write something like this,

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.710
I might say phishing campaigns remain one of the most highly used techniques by

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:14.625
bad actors seeking to gain unauthorized access to our organization and its assets.

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:20.640
As a reminder, phishing attempts occur when a bad actor sends e-mail messages,

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.300
attempting to trick users into clicking on a malicious link,

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.100
or provide personal information like corporate credentials in a web form.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.215
More often than not,

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:36.075
these e-mails are made to appear as if they are coming from well-known organizations,

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:39.840
companies, or organizations that we work with.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.695
It's important to scrutinize every e-mail.

00:00:43.695 --> 00:00:47.370
Often, phishing e-mails have spelling errors,

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.705
look slightly different in appearance,

00:00:49.705 --> 00:00:53.525
or originate from some unexpected source.

00:00:53.525 --> 00:00:57.805
But sometimes, phishing e-mails look perfectly harmless.

00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:02.735
So you should also scrutinize what the e-mail is asking you to do.

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:04.910
Does it seem out of the ordinary?

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.235
Is it something that you wouldn't ordinarily do outside of work,

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:12.300
like send money to someone unexpectedly?

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:17.110
If you receive a phishing e-mail or you just aren't sure,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.150
contact the Information Security Department

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:24.270
