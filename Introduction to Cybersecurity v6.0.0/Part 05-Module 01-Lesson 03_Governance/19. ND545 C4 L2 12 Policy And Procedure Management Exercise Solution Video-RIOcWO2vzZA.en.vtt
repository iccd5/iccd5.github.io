00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.895
The solution for this exercise is very similar to the last example that we gave.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:09.570
In this instance, there are two things that are missing,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.325
the purpose and the scope.

00:00:11.325 --> 00:00:13.035
In terms of purpose,

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.935
we need to be definitive and clear as to the purpose.

00:00:16.935 --> 00:00:21.180
If this is an acceptable use policy that dictates user behavior,

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.155
that's what we need to say.

00:00:23.155 --> 00:00:25.230
Then in terms of scope,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.660
we need to make it clear that the acceptable use policy applies to every user,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.365
assuming of course that that's what the policy should apply to.

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:38.445
Then if we look at the detail of the policy that actually exists,

00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:44.665
under end-user devices, it says that users should only use laptops, etc.

00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:47.250
Should, of course, is passive.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.500
Then going further, it also says that no additional software should

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.960
be installed on laptops without the expressed consent of an IT department.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.300
Again, should is passive.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.985
We should be using determinative language like must or shall.

00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:05.430
Then finally, looking at patching and updating,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.120
there's an entire procedure around patching and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.925
updating that's been made to be part of the policy.

00:01:10.925 --> 00:01:12.800
It's just too much detail.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.880
We of course need to take this information and move it into a procedure.
