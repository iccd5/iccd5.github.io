00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
Congratulations, we've now made it through Governance.

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:06.480
In this lesson, you learned about thinking

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.719
strategically and interacting with business stakeholders.

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.855
You also learned about championing security

00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:16.740
and interacting with end users throughout the organization.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.620
In addition to that, you learned how to design

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.775
measurement tools for measuring the effectiveness of your security controls,

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:29.100
and then how to report those results out to end-users and stakeholders.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.920
Then finally, we talked about policies and

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.450
procedures and how those should be used to dictate employee behavior.
