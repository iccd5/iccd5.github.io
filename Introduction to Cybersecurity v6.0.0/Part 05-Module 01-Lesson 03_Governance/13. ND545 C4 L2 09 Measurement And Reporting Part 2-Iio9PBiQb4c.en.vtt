00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920
Let's examine this scenario.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.615
What if your organization maintains an information security policy?

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:10.260
These require to be updated one time every year.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.670
The purpose of that,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.720
is to ensure that accurate information is provided to every employee.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.000
What's the time component here?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.915
What's one time per year?

00:00:19.915 --> 00:00:24.420
What's the function? The function is to update the policy.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.270
So what about our measurement options?

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.080
What makes sense given the information that you have?

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.520
Could you check periodically throughout the year to make sure that the policy is updated?

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.130
Sure. Could you check one time

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.875
near the end of the year to make sure the policy was updated?

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:45.530
You could do that also. There are probably others that you can think of.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.525
Now in that previous example,

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:50.435
we wanted to make sure that the policy was updated.

00:00:50.435 --> 00:00:52.475
But what if it wasn't?

00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:55.850
Remember that the overall objectives of control

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:59.945
assessment include: improving security posture,

00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:02.270
assessing our existing tools,

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:04.930
and then addressing compliance requirements.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.895
So when a control fails your test,

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:09.965
you have to take action.

00:01:09.965 --> 00:01:14.875
Typically, that comes in the form of reporting and remediation plans.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:18.200
There are three critical tasks that governance

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.590
professionals must complete when measuring control effectiveness.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.315
The first, we just talked about: designing an effective measurement strategy.

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.855
The second, is maintaining a comprehensive schedule

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.970
for all the measurement activities you plan to perform throughout the year.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:39.785
Without that list, you might fail to complete some of the required testing objectives.

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:45.940
Then third, you must maintain a list of all of the tests outcomes.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.500
The reason for recording the test results,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.830
is so that you can report outcomes to stakeholders and then work

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:56.870
together to develop plans of action to remediate any deficiencies.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.155
Just two quick notes here, test results,

00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:04.420
especially failures, represent risks to your organization.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.960
You want to make sure that your plans of action are closely guarded,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.965
and really only shared with appropriate stakeholders.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:17.075
Then second, well, we haven't yet discussed risk management.

00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:20.330
Remediation plans for control failure can actually be

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:25.260
combined with remediation plans resulting from risk management activities.
