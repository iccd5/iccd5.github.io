00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.845
It's always a good idea to measure the effectiveness of your security controls.

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:07.920
The most important reason is that it

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.130
helps improve your security posture and that's a big deal.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.805
Many organizations have hundreds of security controls.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:18.780
Each one of those designed to protect against specific threats.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.440
The governance role helps ensure each one is functioning.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.220
Measurement also allows you to assess existing tools.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.905
It helps you make sure that what you're paying for meets the organization's needs.

00:00:31.905 --> 00:00:35.460
Proofs of concept and product demos are always helpful.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.120
But companies normally don't understand the limitations of software or

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.040
hardware until after the products are installed or running.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.780
Sometimes you have to do it as part of a compliance requirement.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.285
We'll talk about compliance in a separate lesson.

00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:55.990
But you should know that sometimes governance activities are controls themselves.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.940
While you're measuring control effectiveness,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.775
that very action provides another control layer that can be measured.

00:01:03.775 --> 00:01:07.760
Now if your security controls are not operating as intended,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.545
your risk profile actually might be much higher than anticipated.

00:01:12.545 --> 00:01:15.320
Think about checking your door locks at night.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.135
You know the locks are there,

00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:18.655
but you still check them.

00:01:18.655 --> 00:01:22.185
Why? Now, sure, it gives you peace of mind,

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:25.910
but that peace of mind comes from knowing that you've significantly

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.990
reduced the risk of an unwanted guest showing up in your home.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.120
In the last section,

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.600
we talked about time and function as

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.650
the major considerations necessary for measuring control effectiveness.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.620
There are some additional considerations to think about.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.170
I think about the last section as

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.310
discovering what it is that you're attempting to measure.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.215
In this section, we're actually going to talk about how to perform the measurement.

00:01:54.215 --> 00:01:56.900
The actual measurement can be done in a couple of ways.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.295
You can do it manually or you can do it programmatically.

00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:01.925
It can be done once,

00:02:01.925 --> 00:02:05.015
continuously, or scheduled intervals.

00:02:05.015 --> 00:02:11.180
Your only limitations on how you choose to test are based on factors like your budget,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.505
corporate or security strategy,

00:02:13.505 --> 00:02:15.340
and the purpose of your assessment.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.355
Are you measuring the control for internal assessment purposes?

00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:23.585
Are you designing measurement to satisfy an external requirement?

00:02:23.585 --> 00:02:26.270
Knowing that there are many factors in designing

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.405
a test to measure the effectiveness of a security control,

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:31.445
let's walk through that process.

00:02:31.445 --> 00:02:36.635
We first need to understand what it is that we're trying to measure.

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:41.390
We're asking what are the function and time variables for the control?

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.855
Then we need to think about our other considerations.

00:02:44.855 --> 00:02:46.520
These are things like,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.590
what is the purpose of measurement?

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.180
Is it for an internal assessment or an external one?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.930
Does the control need to be measured

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.420
continuously or does it only needs to be measured once or a few times?

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.260
Or what's your budget? What are

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.935
the technical skills that are available to you as resources?

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:07.700
Then finally, do we design a manual test or

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.795
a programmatic one that runs continuously or at specific intervals?

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:15.215
It all depends on your assessment of the control function,

00:03:15.215 --> 00:03:18.350
the time variable, and those other considerations.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.455
Let's look at a brief scenario.

00:03:20.455 --> 00:03:27.530
Imagine that you have a policy that says users shall not take any confidential data home.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.760
The what the function and the time variables are.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.255
That it's a preventive control.

00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:39.445
It's intended to not allow users to take data home, but it's policy-based.

00:03:39.445 --> 00:03:42.565
So there's really no technology enforcing it,

00:03:42.565 --> 00:03:44.590
and there is no timing element.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.650
So we're going to have to assume that it's continuous.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.255
The policy never wants an employee to take confidential data home.

00:03:52.255 --> 00:03:55.750
Now how would you test and make sure that control works?

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.015
Let's think through our other considerations.

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:03.895
If you didn't have very much budget and you just wanted to test at one time,

00:04:03.895 --> 00:04:05.395
you could send out a survey.

00:04:05.395 --> 00:04:07.330
That doesn't take a lot of effort.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.180
But employees can answer really any way they want it.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.020
So maybe that's not effective.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.505
What if you wanted more certainty?

00:04:14.505 --> 00:04:18.470
You could stop every single employee one

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.630
evening and then check to make sure that they

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.960
weren't taking any confidential data with them.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.550
Now, that also doesn't take a lot of effort,

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.925
but it only measures the control effectiveness wants.

00:04:28.925 --> 00:04:33.870
Is that good enough? What would you do if you wanted to check everyday?
