00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Well, it's important that influence at the highest levels of

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.080
the organization through something like the Information Security Steering Committee.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.360
It's just as important to influence every user in the organization through training.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.040
We said that governance professionals have overall responsibility for writing,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.780
maintaining, and assessing security policies and procedures.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.125
That makes them perfectly positioned to train users.

00:00:25.125 --> 00:00:30.914
Why? Because end-users need to understand what's in the policies,

00:00:30.914 --> 00:00:33.870
and the policies should describe what is and is

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.600
not permitted as it relates to security in

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:43.240
the organization or what they should do if they suspect a security incident.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.655
We just said that companies train employees on policies

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:50.105
so that they have an understanding of what's contained in the policies.

00:00:50.105 --> 00:00:52.580
But what are the benefits to the company?

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.490
They're really four main benefits.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.045
First of all, it helps reduce security risks.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.700
By training employees on certain topics,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.045
it can help them spot and avoid security threats,

00:01:05.045 --> 00:01:08.350
reducing the overall risk of a security incident.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.110
In that way, training also helps to strengthen

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.290
your existing security controls by providing employees

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.055
with enough information to act as another line of defense.

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:22.740
You may, for instance, have anti phishing mechanisms in place.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.690
But if a phishing email reaches just one untrained employee,

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.855
it can create an immediate security incident.

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.215
To strengthen your phishing controls and reduce your risk,

00:01:33.215 --> 00:01:35.900
you can train employees on what to look for and how to

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.425
react if they realize that they've been successfully phished.

00:01:39.425 --> 00:01:44.645
Security training for end-users is also very often a compliance requirement.

00:01:44.645 --> 00:01:48.020
Finally, what's great about training employees in

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.520
the workplace is that those skills can translate to employee homes as well.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.670
All of that training can create a life skill that will help

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.480
protect employees anytime that they're using technology.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.870
I said something earlier about security training videos.

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.500
I'm sure you've set through at least one of those at some point.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.315
I think they get a bad rap.

00:02:08.315 --> 00:02:11.960
They can be really great mechanisms for reaching a number of people

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.665
at the same time and providing consistent content.

00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:20.720
But there are plenty of other ways that you can engage your employees in meaningful ways.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.580
Now I currently do all of these,

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.285
there are things like live security incident drills,

00:02:26.285 --> 00:02:30.125
test phishing emails, live hacking demonstrations,

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:33.695
newsletter content, or even vendor demonstrations.

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:37.070
My favorites are the ones that really engage the users.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.345
You can't always be creative,

00:02:39.345 --> 00:02:41.930
but when a user goes home and tells her family about

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.100
that cool security thing that they learned at work today, you've done your job.
