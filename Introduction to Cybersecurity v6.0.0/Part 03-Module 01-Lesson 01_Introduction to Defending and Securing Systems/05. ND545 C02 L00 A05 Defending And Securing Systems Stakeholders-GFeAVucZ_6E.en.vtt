00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
As you just learned,

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.620
cybersecurity applies to pretty much everyone on the planet.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.720
But let's look specifically inside

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.930
a typical organization to see who the stakeholders are.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.240
First up, we have your customers.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.090
The customer is trusting in your organization that

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.330
their payment and their personal information are in good hands.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.490
Next, we have the employees.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.150
An employee is trusting the security program to protect their information,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.760
but also the intellectual property they generate.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.890
Management are in place to implement

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.475
the security program and ensure that it is functioning properly.

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:36.570
The owners or shareholders of the organization are putting their trust in

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.750
the management that their investment in the company is safe and ideally profitable.

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.215
Your company's business partners have a vested interest in your security program,

00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:49.705
as there may be data connections and data exchange between the two organizations.

00:00:49.705 --> 00:00:52.550
Finally, the government may be a stakeholder if

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.640
your organization is subject to any compliance regulations.
