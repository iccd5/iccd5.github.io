00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
Let's do a quick overview of this course.

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:06.885
Lesson 1 will give us a working knowledge of defense in depth.

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.600
We'll explore the NIST 800 framework

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.735
and we'll take a look at the principle of least privilege.

00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:15.375
Lesson 2 has a lot to take in.

00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.280
We'll begin with the different types of

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.789
firewalls and how to create a basic firewall rule.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.480
We'll take a look at best practices for securing enterprise wireless,

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.150
then we'll learn about intrusion detection systems and

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.515
intrusion protection systems including writing a basic IDS signature.

00:00:31.515 --> 00:00:36.605
We close this lesson out with a look at securing Windows and Linux operating systems.

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:40.130
Lesson 3 is all about detection and response.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.830
We learn about system event logs,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.395
monitoring network traffic, and close it out with a look at SIEMs.

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:48.995
In the final lesson,

00:00:48.995 --> 00:00:51.994
we go through an introduction to encryption,

00:00:51.994 --> 00:00:54.350
then we learn about encryption in transit,

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.619
and we close it out with file hashes and digital signatures.
