It is important to know what encryption you are utilizing in your environment.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.865
Let's check the encryption we're using for SSH on our CentOS Lab machine.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:17.400
Type sudo sshd -T and then | grep with cipher in quotes,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.829
you will be asked to re-authenticate.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.540
As you can see, this server supports

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.470
all three AES algorithms as well as Blowfish and triple-DES.
