00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.305
How do you know which encryption method is right for data in transit?

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:09.345
In this case, the choices are a bit more clear based on what you're trying to accomplish.

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:13.710
If you are processing or hosting sensitive data accessible from the Internet,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.725
you'll want to use HTTPS TLS.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.425
If you are hosting servers, particularly Linux,

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:23.040
to execute commands and process jobs, use SSH.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.980
If you are hosting files for others to download,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.950
you can use either SFTP or FTPS,

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.020
depending on the configuration of the host they reside on.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.380
For additional security, consider using encryption at rest on files

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:41.530
that are to be accessed via SSH or SFTP or FTPS.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.665
If you recall from a previous lesson.

00:00:43.665 --> 00:00:48.575
It is wise to not have SSH open to the Internet likewise, RDP.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:53.335
Consider setting up a VPN for those use cases as an additional layer of security.

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:55.795
Wow, that was a lot of encryption talk,

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:58.820
we'll provide some links in the classroom if you want to learn more.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.000
But the important takeaway is that you can figure out which type of

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.450
encryption is best for your situation and keep everything secure.
