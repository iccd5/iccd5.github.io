00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.585
Earlier this lesson, we ran a Python script to show the Caesar cipher in action.

00:00:04.585 --> 00:00:07.200
Say for instance, I wanted to send a script to you,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.185
and if we wanted to be sure the script wasn't manipulated,

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:14.370
we could use the file hash feature to compare the digital fingerprint of the file.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.795
Let's take a look at the hash for the script.

00:00:16.795 --> 00:00:19.010
For this, I'm using PowerShell.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.780
You simply type in get dash file hash,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.955
and the path plus filename.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:26.505
If PowerShell is already in the directory,

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:29.745
you simply type get dash file hash,

00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:31.740
and then the name of the file,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.780
which in this case it's cc dot py.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:39.010
Here's the SHA256 hash for that file.
