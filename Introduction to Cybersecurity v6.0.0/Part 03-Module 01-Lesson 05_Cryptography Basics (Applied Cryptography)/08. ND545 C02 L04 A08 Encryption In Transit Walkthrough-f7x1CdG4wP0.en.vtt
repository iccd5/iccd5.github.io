00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Let's take a look at the encryption for google.com.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.580
Navigate there in your favorite web browser,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.280
and click the Lock in the far left of the address bar.

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.755
We'll look at what encryption is being used,

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:14.340
what TLS version, then we'll look at the certificate.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.520
Note, the following screenshots are from Firefox.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.590
If you're using Chrome or another browser,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.745
the visuals will be different,

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:22.530
but the information will be the same.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.765
The encryption information is highlighted.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:30.330
Notice we're running AES 128-bit encryption and TLS version 1.3.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.480
Now click on the "View Certificate" button.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.015
Here you can see the issuer of the certificate is Google Trust Services.

00:00:38.015 --> 00:00:39.355
You can see the dates,

00:00:39.355 --> 00:00:40.850
the certificate is valid.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.675
You can also see the site is using the elliptic curve algorithm,

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:48.170
which is a variation of the Diffie-Hellman algorithm we learned about.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.210
The public key is shown at the bottom.
