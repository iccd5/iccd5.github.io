00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
Welcome to the final lesson.

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:04.140
Let's turn our attention to cryptography.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:06.465
We've already learned about securing our hosts,

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:08.010
now we need to secure our data,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.650
and what's more important than that in cyber security.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.740
We'll go through an introduction to encryption,

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.125
then we'll learn about encryption in transit,

00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:20.890
and we'll close it out with file hashes and digital signatures. Let's dig in.
