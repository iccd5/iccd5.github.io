00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
Welcome to introduction to cybersecurity.

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:07.710
Congratulations, you have just stepped into the very first lesson of the course.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.555
Have you ever been hacked?

00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:12.300
Most of us have been in one form or

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.930
another that's why we have such a need to learn security.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.770
Many organizations are looking for qualified security professionals too.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.320
After this welcome lesson,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.870
we will start with a brief explanation of why

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.569
cybersecurity is so critical in today's world,

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.004
and what it means to be safe and secure online.

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:35.400
We move onto what it means to maintain a secure infrastructure,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.480
and administer a system that meets industry security standards.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.660
The next lesson gets you thinking like a hacker in assessing high-level risks,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.245
vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks.

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:50.705
Once you know how a data breach may happen,

00:00:50.705 --> 00:00:53.299
you need to enable adequate defenses,

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.535
which is covered in lesson 5.

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:57.320
With all of this knowledge,

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.390
you'll practice applying cybersecurity on a sample system using a case study.
