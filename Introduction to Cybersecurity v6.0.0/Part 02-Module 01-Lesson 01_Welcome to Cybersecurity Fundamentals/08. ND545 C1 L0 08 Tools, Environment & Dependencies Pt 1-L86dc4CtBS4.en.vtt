00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.365
To work in cyber security you need to be familiar with typical environments,

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:06.525
operating systems, and tools.

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:10.350
In this course, we'll mainly focus on the Windows 10 operating system,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.805
since it's the predominant platform for most end-users and business.

00:00:14.805 --> 00:00:19.020
It's okay if you don't have one to use as we'll give you access to one.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.860
Most Windows operating systems come with built-in security tools.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.270
Some of the Windows components you'll use are the Control Panel,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.875
Computer Management, and Local Security Policies.

00:00:31.875 --> 00:00:37.665
I'll describe each one of these native Windows capabilities in depth in future videos.

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:42.185
There are also other tools that help you as a cybersecurity professional,

00:00:42.185 --> 00:00:45.230
these include Sysinternals Suite.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.690
We use these utilities to troubleshoot, diagnose,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.095
and manage Windows operating systems and applications.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:54.890
Windows God Mode, which is simply a shortcut folder

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.800
containing Windows utilities found in the Control Panel and Computer Management.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.430
NMap network mapper, which is a tool for mapping networks.

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.865
You can see the device and IP addresses on a network.

00:01:07.865 --> 00:01:11.090
7-Zip, a simple application for

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.005
compressing files that can also be used for simple encryption.

00:01:15.005 --> 00:01:18.790
Now let me show you how to use these different tools.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.820
The first group of security tools I encourage you to check out,

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.250
it is called the Sysinternal Suite.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.705
They've actually been around from over 15 years,

00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:33.890
and I use these daily to help me manage Windows systems.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:41.620
They are freely available from microsoftdocs.microsoft.com Sysinternals. You can Bing it.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.655
I say Bing because it's Microsoft of course.

00:01:44.655 --> 00:01:46.775
With this suite of tools,

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:50.465
you can better administer Windows systems.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:55.280
Once you download and unzip the Sysinternal tools,

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.520
you'll be given a folder with all of these tools.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.990
You can use them to create multiple desktops for clocks.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.980
One of my favorites though is called Autoruns.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.145
Let me show you what it looks like.

00:02:08.145 --> 00:02:12.945
I am now running the program Autoruns from Sysinternals Suite.

00:02:12.945 --> 00:02:17.615
Have you ever had a program start on a Windows machine that you can't figure it out?

00:02:17.615 --> 00:02:19.505
How to stop it from starting?

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:21.970
Autoruns will solve this.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.385
When you open it,

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:27.185
it will show you all of the different potential programs that could be starting.

00:02:27.185 --> 00:02:33.275
If there is a checkbox next to one of the applications,

00:02:33.275 --> 00:02:36.620
then it automatically starts when your Windows system starts.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.530
For example, I have a Wondershare Helper that's

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.820
automatically starting even though the file is no longer found.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.515
To stop it, simply uncheck it.

00:02:45.515 --> 00:02:48.200
There's no more actions you need to take.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.310
Autoruns is a must have as part of your security toolkit.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.320
There are many other programs available through the Sysinternal Suite.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.915
Download it and try it.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:04.805
On the exercise Windows 10 system you're given as part of this course,

00:03:04.805 --> 00:03:07.910
Sysinternals Suite should be available giving

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.060
you an opportunity to learn a little bit more about it.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.360
The next tool I'm going to show you is called God Mode.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.050
All this does, it's like an Easter egg on Windows.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.990
It creates a folder with all of the administrator commands.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:26.315
To enable God Mode on a Windows 10 system,

00:03:26.315 --> 00:03:29.490
you need to know the secret code and it's not really very secret.

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.900
I just saved it in Google to make it easy,

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.490
to enable a folder on your desktop with God Mode, really easy.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:40.025
What you do is you just need to create a new folder,

00:03:40.025 --> 00:03:44.750
and then rename it using the special code, hit "Enter".

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:50.470
Now you'll see a special Control Panel icon with no name associated with it.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.550
When you open it,

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.070
you will actually see it named God Mode,

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.220
and these are all of the different control tasks tools.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.465
Rather than trying to search through the Control Panel with Windows,

00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:04.070
you now have one folder,

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:07.660
makes it so much easier to administer Windows system.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.060
Another tool I want to show you is called Nmap,

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.160
which is a simply a network mapper.

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.850
It looks for IP addresses on a particular network.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.520
Whatever network you ask it to explore,

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.445
you can learn about it at nmap.org.

00:04:22.445 --> 00:04:27.350
There will be a whole session about using Nmap later in the course.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.850
This is just a tickler,

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:30.380
go out to nmap.org,

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.460
begin to learn about it.
