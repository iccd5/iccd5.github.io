against cyber-based attacks and high technology crimes.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.630
What is cyber security?

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.235
According to the National Institute of Standards and Technology,

00:00:34.235 --> 00:00:35.570
also known as NIST,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.575
it's the prevention of damage to, protection of,

00:00:39.575 --> 00:00:42.530
and restoration of computers, electronic communication systems,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.285
electronic communication services, wire communication, and electronic communication,

00:00:47.285 --> 00:00:52.505
including information contained therein to ensure its availability,

00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:58.180
integrity, authentication, confidentiality, and nonrepudiation.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.370
Throughout this course, you'll gain an understanding of
