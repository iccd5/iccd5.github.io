00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
Everyone is online and computers are all around us in our pockets,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.030
on our wrist, in our cars,

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:07.890
in our homes, and of course,

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.810
around us in our businesses.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.700
With all of this technology,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.190
comes risks and dangers.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.340
What if someone was able to gain access to your computer's accounts and sensitive data?

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.465
How much damage could they do?

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:26.670
What do you need to do to secure your technologies?

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.735
It's up to each of us to do our part in securing our cyber world.

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:32.160
Failure to do so,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.510
not only affects you,

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:34.980
but the world, businesses,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.375
and people around you.

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:39.535
That should be a reason why you're in this course.

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:42.410
For example, you click on a link in an e-mail,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.710
not realizing that it leads to a malicious website,

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.430
that then download some ransomware on your computer and holds

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.535
your organizations critical information hostage

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:55.820
until you pace a Bitcoin to get it released.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.135
Learning how to protect yourself better online,

00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:01.955
maybe one reason you're in this course.

00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:06.770
Another reason maybe to get employed in a cybersecurity career.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.790
According to Security magazine,

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.500
76 percent of cybersecurity leaders believe there is a shortage of cybersecurity skills.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.300
That means, there are many opportunities for cybersecurity professionals.
