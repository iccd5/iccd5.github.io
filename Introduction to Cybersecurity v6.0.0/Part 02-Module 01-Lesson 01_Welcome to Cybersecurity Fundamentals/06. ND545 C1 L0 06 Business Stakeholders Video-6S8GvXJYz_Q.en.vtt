According to the Federal Communications Commission or FCC,

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.620
the Internet allows businesses of all sizes, types, industries,

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.280
and from any location to reach new and larger markets and provides

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.540
opportunities to work more efficiently by using computer-based tools.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.570
Whether your organization is thinking about adopting

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.705
Cloud computing or just using e-mail and maintaining a website,

00:00:24.705 --> 00:00:27.570
cybersecurity should be part of the plan.

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.000
Theft of digital information has become

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.190
the most commonly reported fraud surpassing physical theft.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.215
Every business that uses the Internet,

00:00:38.215 --> 00:00:41.255
is responsible for creating a culture of security

00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:44.915
that will enhance business and consumer confidence.

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:48.170
Securing businesses, is another reason why it's important to

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.380
study cybersecurity not only in this audacity course,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.695
but also throughout your career.

00:00:53.695 --> 00:00:56.405
The US Federal Trade Commission's website,

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:00.140
ftc.gov on cybersecurity for small business,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.280
provides information all businesses need to know to protect their technologies,

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.670
data and people from cyber attacks.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.780
The FTC provides information on some of the topics we'll cover in this class,

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.045
such as cybersecurity basics,

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:17.330
understanding the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.500
physical security, attacks such as ransomware and fishing, and email security.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.880
The FTC website is more evidence of the importance of cybersecurity for business.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.500
Consider it as a resource,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.810
not only in this course in nanodegree,

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.330
but throughout your professional career.
