00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
In this course, we'll spend time walking through five areas of focus.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.090
First, we'll create context around GRC and set

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.415
ourselves up for the remaining course elements

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:14.235
during an introduction of cyber security, GRC.

00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:16.035
In the next three lessons,

00:00:16.035 --> 00:00:21.045
we'll spend time looking at the role of each part of GRC: governance,

00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:24.570
risk, and compliance respectively.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.240
Then finally, near the end of the course,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.190
we'll discuss one additional critical GRC component in audit management.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:34.335
In the GRC overview lesson,

00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.990
we'll learn about security GRC,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.935
defining GRC roles, how GRC roles interrelate with each other,

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:46.085
and then how we need to interpret organizational GRC needs.

00:00:46.085 --> 00:00:47.795
In the governance lesson,

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.150
we'll learn about what governance is,

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.205
how to think strategically,

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:55.670
how governance professionals champion security,

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:57.965
how we design control measurement,

00:00:57.965 --> 00:01:00.079
how to report those measurements,

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.225
and then finally, how to build policies and procedures for organizations.

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:07.970
Then in the lesson on risk,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.495
we are going to learn about understanding risk management,

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:15.229
how risk management works in practice,

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.630
and also how businesses deal with risk today.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.595
In our compliance lesson,

00:01:21.595 --> 00:01:23.960
we'll learn about compliance as a whole,

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.750
where sources of obligations originate,

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.990
how to evaluate our compliance obligations,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.715
and then finally, how to perform control assessments.

00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:36.245
Finally, in audit fundamentals,

00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:39.455
we'll go over audit management fundamentals

00:01:39.455 --> 00:01:43.230
and then how we follow up in remediate findings.
