00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
Before beginning this course,

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:05.715
you should have some basic cyber security knowledge.

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:10.440
In particular, you should have a general understanding of security controls,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:18.060
what they are, the different categories of controls and where and how they're applied.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.875
We won't be spending a lot of time talking about security control specifically.

00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:27.240
But understanding the function will help you work through various examples.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.305
Now in addition, you should have a high level understanding of how businesses operate.

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:34.760
Because we do talk throughout the course about

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.730
engaging with various levels of the business,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.250
supporting business goals, and the roles of various business and IT stakeholders.
