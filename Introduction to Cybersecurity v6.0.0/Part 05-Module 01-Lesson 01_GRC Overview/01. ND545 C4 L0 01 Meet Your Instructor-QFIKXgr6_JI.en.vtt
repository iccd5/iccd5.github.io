00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
Welcome to Governance, Risk,

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.300
and Compliance for Cybersecurity.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.015
My name is Sean Pike and I'll be your instructor.

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.220
I'm really happy that you could join us

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.900
and I'm excited about the content we'll be sharing.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.230
Now just so you know me a little better,

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.380
I've practiced Cybersecurity for about 20 years,

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.460
and most of that has been in some form of highly regulated industry,

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.724
from healthcare to financial services,

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:25.065
to publicly traded companies.

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:28.215
That's where I learned the value of GRC.

00:00:28.215 --> 00:00:30.900
The beginning of my career coincided with

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.440
so many important regulatory events that I was forced

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.990
to understand the relationship between IT

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.665
and outside influences like regulation and risk management.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:44.315
In fact, I became so focused on harmonizing

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:48.410
IT and IT security with those external forces,

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.065
that I helped to create an IT audit firm,

00:00:51.065 --> 00:00:56.600
some GRC software, and then I pursued some higher education opportunities.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.385
I'm also an attorney,

00:00:58.385 --> 00:01:00.890
admitted to practice in the state of Maryland,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.805
and I have a Master's Degree in Telecommunications.

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:07.400
But all of that really done in the pursuit of assisting

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.590
organizations in developing mature Cybersecurity and GRC practices.
