00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.505
Now that we've talked a little bit about me,

00:00:02.505 --> 00:00:05.850
let's jump into what we're going to cover in this lesson.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.350
First, we'll discuss the prerequisites needed to go through this course,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.630
then we'll outline the course and break down what we're

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.225
going to learn in each subsequent lesson.

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:19.020
We'll set the stage for why GRC is important,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.830
and then we'll talk about who the relevant business stakeholders are.

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.620
Finally, we'll take a brief look at

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.950
the project and what you're going to build at the end of this course.
