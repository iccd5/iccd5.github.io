00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.445
IT security or cybersecurity.

00:00:02.445 --> 00:00:05.130
Now that's what really makes the headlines.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.590
You see plenty of reported news about

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.590
high profile breaches like those occurring at Target,

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.115
Equifax, or government agencies.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:19.275
You see TV shows and movies that extol hacking and cyber espionage.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:22.410
That creates this mythos about the struggle between

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.055
bad actors versus good cybersecurity professionals.

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:27.885
There's some truth to that.

00:00:27.885 --> 00:00:31.250
But a large part of cybersecurity is making sure that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.865
your organization is effective and efficient.

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:38.285
Making sure that your protections work as expected,

00:00:38.285 --> 00:00:41.615
cover gaps, and use resources wisely.

00:00:41.615 --> 00:00:46.040
GRC acts as a support structure to do just that.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.530
That's what makes GRC so important.
