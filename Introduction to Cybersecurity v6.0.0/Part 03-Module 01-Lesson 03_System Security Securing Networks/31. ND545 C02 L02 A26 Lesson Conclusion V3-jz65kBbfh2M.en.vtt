00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.830
As I mentioned in the opening,

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.640
this was quite the busy lesson,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.265
we learned about firewalls,

00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:08.985
including the different types and crafting a basic rule.

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:12.120
We learned how to choose the appropriate wireless solution,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.280
authentication method, and additional security tips for our wireless infrastructure.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:22.080
Then we learned about intrusion detection and crafted our own IDS signature.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.180
Finally, we closed things out with a look at securing and updating Windows and Linux.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.175
You should be proud of what you've learned so far,

00:00:29.175 --> 00:00:31.270
it was a lot to take in.
