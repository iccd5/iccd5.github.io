00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Let's take a look at the firewall exercise.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:06.450
You were tasked with creating a firewall rule. Let's see how you did.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.220
Using Cisco syntax, compose a firewall rule allowing the IP address

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.370
150.220.31.199 access to IP

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:25.485
address 172.28.16.15 on port TCP-9001.

00:00:25.485 --> 00:00:27.075
Name the source IP,

00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:32.625
Central-001 and the destination IP, Web-001.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.480
Use you Udacity-ingress as the interface.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.280
Here's what you should have come up with.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.290
The command to name an object is;

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.375
name, the IP address,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.040
and then the name you'd like to use.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.385
We did this for both source and destination objects.

00:00:48.385 --> 00:00:51.605
Finally, you should have access list,

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:57.380
the interface used, in this case you Udacity-ingress, then extended permit,

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.980
TCP host, the source object,

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.224
which we named Central-001 host,

00:01:05.224 --> 00:01:08.490
and then the destination object of Web-001,

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.040
eq and in the port 9001.
