00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.925
A firewall is an absolute must have.

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:08.100
Properly configured wireless further protect your organization from [inaudible].

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.660
Now we're ready to take our security to

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.810
the next level and add intrusion detection to our arsenal.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.140
We'll learn the difference between IDS and IPS.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.230
We'll analyze the basic IDS rule, and craft our own.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.435
The objectives for this section are,

00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:22.950
what is an IDS?

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.520
The differences between IDS and IPS.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.530
We'll break down an IDS signature and we'll craft our own.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.105
Where does intrusion detection fall in our three component model of security?

00:00:35.105 --> 00:00:38.815
It has detection for sure and IPS has response.

00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:41.850
An IDS is an intrusion detection system.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.395
It can be a hardware appliance or a virtual machine.

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:47.660
An IDS is a passive tool.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.579
It only monitors and reports.

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.150
It is up to the security analysts to take action.

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.120
An IDS is generally placed at the edge of your network.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:59.675
However, if you would also like to monitor internal traffic,

00:00:59.675 --> 00:01:02.125
you can place inside the network as well.

00:01:02.125 --> 00:01:05.430
An IDS operates based on signature or

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.850
rules and some are also heuristic or behavior-based.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.800
An IPS is an intrusion prevention system that is active rather than passive.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.040
It has the same basic architecture, rules,

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.690
and functions as an IDS,

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.705
but it will take action against the threat.

00:01:22.705 --> 00:01:24.975
Anatomy of an IDS rule.

00:01:24.975 --> 00:01:27.655
For this exercise, we'll be using Snort.

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:31.020
Snort is the most commonly used IDS.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:38.330
Here is a sample snort rule to alert on RPC traffic to our IP address and port 111.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.255
Alert tells us that when the rule fires,

00:01:41.255 --> 00:01:43.715
it will send an alert to the administrator.

00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:48.595
The first any tells us this rule applies to any source IP.

00:01:48.595 --> 00:01:53.015
The second any indicates any source port will fire the alert.

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:56.575
The arrow indicates the direction of the traffic.

00:01:56.575 --> 00:02:00.215
The destination IP is our example IP address.

00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:04.010
The destination port is our tcp 111 port.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.410
The rule options include the message

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.695
the administrator will receive as well as the sid number.

00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:12.335
Reminder: in custom signatures,

00:02:12.335 --> 00:02:15.275
your sid number must be one million or higher.

00:02:15.275 --> 00:02:21.180
The first 999,999 are native to Snort.
