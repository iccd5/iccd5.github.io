00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
Let's check how you did on the IDS exercise.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.990
Your web server has been receiving a high volume of FTP login attempts,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.595
and you were tasked with writing a snort rule to alert the administrator.

00:00:11.595 --> 00:00:13.530
Here's what you should have come up with.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.670
Alert tells us the administrator would be notified when the rule fires.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.805
We're alerting on any source, IP and port.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:25.935
We have our IP address and a range of ports from 20-23.

00:00:25.935 --> 00:00:29.460
The message is FTP connection attempt.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.565
The sid just needs to be one million or higher.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:38.560
Rev 1, lets us know this is the first instance of the rule but isn't required.
