00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.890
Welcome to Securing Networks.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.919
Now that you know about defense in depth, NIST,

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:06.495
and the principle of least privilege,

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:09.915
we can start applying these principles to networks and systems.

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:13.470
This lesson on system security is quite the busy lesson.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.600
If you recall from the previous lesson,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.625
security is a layered proposition;

00:00:17.625 --> 00:00:20.265
prevent, detect, and respond.

00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:23.415
We'll cover portions of all three components in this lesson.

00:00:23.415 --> 00:00:25.290
We'll begin with the different types of

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.440
firewalls and how to create a basic firewall rule.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.645
We'll take a look at best practices for securing enterprise wireless.

00:00:32.645 --> 00:00:36.935
Then we'll learn about intrusion detection systems and intrusion protection systems,

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:39.785
including running a basic IDS signature.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:42.500
We'll close this lesson out with a look at Securing

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.050
Windows and Linux systems. Let's get started.
