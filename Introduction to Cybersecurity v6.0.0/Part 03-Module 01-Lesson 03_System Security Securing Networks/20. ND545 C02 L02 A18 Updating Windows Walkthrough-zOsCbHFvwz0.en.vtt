00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
Let's walk through viewing installed updates on our Windows Server.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.900
Select the Windows key and type PowerShell.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.005
From here, type Get-HotFix.

00:00:14.005 --> 00:00:16.530
These are the installed updates.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.790
The description tells you if it's a standard update or in this case, a security update.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.465
The Hot FixID contains very valuable information.

00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:25.845
You can take the KB,

00:00:25.845 --> 00:00:27.495
also known as knowledge base,

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:31.260
and Google it, and it will give you information about that particular update.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.730
Then on the far right,

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.430
you see the date that the update was installed.
