00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's talk about automated threat intelligence for a moment.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.540
With firewalls, we are specifically talking about

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.825
subscription based blacklisting and dynamic blacklisting.

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:14.025
But before we go into that let's discuss blacklist in more detail.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.370
A blacklist, also known as a blocklist,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:22.320
is a list of IP addresses that are not allowed to communicate with IPs on your network.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.055
There are three primary types of IP blacklists.

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:28.830
A manual blacklist is a blacklist where

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.375
the security analyst manually adds and removes IP addresses.

00:00:33.375 --> 00:00:36.930
A subscription based or automated blacklist is where

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.480
your organization subscribes to one or more blacklists that are maintained by others.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.560
This can be open source or commercial in nature.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.010
A dynamic blacklist is a blacklist that adapts to threats.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.365
For instance, if an IP address suddenly attempts thousands of SSH connections,

00:00:54.365 --> 00:00:56.870
it will automatically blacklist the IP.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:02.170
This will require a firewall or peripheral device that allows this type of configuration.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.890
A quick note, sometimes dynamic subscription are used interchangeably.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.345
In this lesson, we'll be using them the way we just defined.

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:12.950
It is understandable to want to maintain

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.280
full control of the technology you are responsible for.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.110
However, with the threat landscape changing and growing at ever increasing speed,

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.545
it is simply untenable to think that one person or

00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:29.380
even a team can adequately monitor and maintain a blacklist for an organization.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.350
Consider that IPv4 addresses provide over four billion possible IPs,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.200
and with IPv6 being integrated into the conversation more frequently every day,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.130
you can forget about trying to block individual IPs.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.120
By subscribing to one or more blacklist and using dynamic blocking technology,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.630
you are adding additional layers of security for your organization.
