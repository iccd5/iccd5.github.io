00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.340
Now that we've learned about firewalls,

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.965
let's look at the next fundamental concept.

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:09.344
With more and more organizations utilizing laptops, tablets,

00:00:09.344 --> 00:00:11.700
phones, and IoT devices,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.445
wireless security is more important than ever.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:18.839
When we factor in that wireless can pass through the walls, ceilings,

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:20.625
and floors of our organization,

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:23.535
it's clear the security has to be right.

00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:27.135
We'll learn about securing your enterprise wireless environment,

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:29.940
we'll evaluate best practices on security,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.150
as well as implementing the appropriate authentication methods.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.090
The objectives we'll cover in this section are choosing an appropriate solution,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.280
choosing an authentication method,

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.260
learning additional security best practices.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.475
Where does secure wireless fit in our three component model of security?

00:00:47.475 --> 00:00:50.120
It's certainly prevention, but could also be

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.245
detection and respond depending on your configuration.

00:00:53.245 --> 00:00:56.360
Choosing the appropriate wireless solution for your business can

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.495
make securing it easier and growth more manageable.

00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:02.930
You don't want a home-based solution or one that is

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.595
too big and will require more care and feeding than you can support.

00:01:06.595 --> 00:01:11.360
You'll find that software upgrades are needed as your clients' phones,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.280
computers, and tablets evolve.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.320
A company that doesn't stop working on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.310
its product once it has been released is desirable.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.220
Avoid any vendors that are known for only supporting

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.135
a product for X number of years before effectively forcing upgrades.

00:01:26.135 --> 00:01:28.850
A good wireless solution can last for years,

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.710
you want your support too as well.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.690
Does the solution require an on-premises controller or is it cloud based?

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.315
More and more vendors are cloud-based.

00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:41.435
While one is not necessarily better than the other,

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:45.860
it is worth noting that a controller must be properly maintained and will

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.600
potentially change the architecture of

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.280
the wireless network if your organization has more than one location.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.240
Is it difficult to add access points?

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.520
How about new physical locations?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.220
Let's take a look at some common authentication methods.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.025
EAP, extensible authentication protocol,

00:02:04.025 --> 00:02:09.410
allows open authentication to allow the client to attach to the access point,

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.945
but then hands it off for network authentication,

00:02:11.945 --> 00:02:13.820
usually with a RADIUS server.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.594
RADIUS stands for Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service,

00:02:19.594 --> 00:02:23.630
and is a centralized database used to authenticate remote users,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.420
usually with Active Directory.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.060
PEAP or protected extensible authentication protocol functions similar to EAP,

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.770
but adds a TLS tunnel.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.340
Preferably you should use something like WPA2 enterprise with 802.1x encryption.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.040
This is by no means an exhaustive list.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.280
There are many other methods of authentication and encryption.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.815
Choose what works best for your situation.

00:02:48.815 --> 00:02:51.650
Now that we've chosen our wireless solution and

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:54.590
implemented our chosen authentication and encryption method.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.230
Let's look at additional security measures we can

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.640
take to secure the organizations wireless infrastructure.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.175
If your access points allow for power adjustment,

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:07.285
lower the power on the edge access points.

00:03:07.285 --> 00:03:11.540
This will keep your signal from bleeding too far outside of the office footprint,

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.760
which will discourage neighbors and malicious actors from attempting to connect.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.550
Many wireless solutions include additional security features,

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:25.795
such as wireless intrusion detection systems or wireless intrusion prevention systems.

00:03:25.795 --> 00:03:28.250
Configured properly, this can help prevent

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.865
rogue access points and other wireless hacking tips.

00:03:31.865 --> 00:03:35.930
Be sure your guest network has the same level of security as

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.350
the primary corporate wireless network and then it routes directly to

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.405
the Internet with zero visibility of your business networks.

00:03:43.405 --> 00:03:48.859
Split your wireless network up into multiple SSIDs and network subnets.

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.510
You should have a network or Internet of Things devices such as thermostats,

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.670
mechanical items, and appliances.
