00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
You were tasked with setting permissions on several folders in your Windows server.

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.010
Let's see how you did. Your result should look something like this.

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.865
It is acceptable if you remove the system and creator owner entries.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:14.400
You should have left the administrators group permissions as they

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.995
were and added the operations group.

00:00:16.995 --> 00:00:19.079
You could give them full control,

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:21.135
modify, or read and write,

00:00:21.135 --> 00:00:23.055
and that would be acceptable as well.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:27.280
Your directories for accounting and HR should look the same.
