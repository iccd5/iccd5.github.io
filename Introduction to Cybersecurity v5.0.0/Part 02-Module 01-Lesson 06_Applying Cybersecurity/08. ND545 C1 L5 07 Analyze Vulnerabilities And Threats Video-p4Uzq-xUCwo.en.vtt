00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.265
Recall from an earlier lesson,

00:00:02.265 --> 00:00:05.130
that a vulnerability is a weakness in an information system,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.280
system security procedures, internal controls,

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.715
or implementation that can be exploited or triggered by a threat.

00:00:12.715 --> 00:00:17.245
A threat is something that can impact or harm a person or organization.

00:00:17.245 --> 00:00:22.410
In this lesson, we explore possible vulnerabilities on a typical Windows system.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.440
Here we'll look at three primary areas within

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.995
the Windows operating system that may contain vulnerabilities.

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.710
The first is shared folders and files.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.660
Folders and files are often shared by users to

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.755
make it easier for others to view or modify them.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:41.960
Windows makes this easy with its sharing function.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.515
However, many businesses will also have a network drive that is shared to all users.

00:00:47.515 --> 00:00:50.180
The threat, is that you don't always know who

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.940
may be able to see or change their contents.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.390
Ransomware is another threat that will often try to lock

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.560
files shared on a network until the ransom is paid.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.680
It's good to know what files and folders are shared on both a PC and across your network.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.165
The second common Windows vulnerability is something known as Windows services.

00:01:12.165 --> 00:01:14.000
In Windows, services are

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.010
all the little executable applications that often run continuously in the background.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.250
They can be automatically started when a computer starts.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.545
Trigger events can also start services like when you run a particular application.

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:31.475
If you ever wondered what happens under the covers of a Window system,

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:33.304
check out the services.

00:01:33.304 --> 00:01:37.190
Services running that aren't needed can bog down a computer.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:40.370
By the way, all types of computers has services running.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.280
This isn't just a Windows thing.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.100
There's also a potential security threat that running services can

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.545
allow unauthorized access to the computer or it's content.

00:01:50.545 --> 00:01:52.940
Security analysts should be familiar with

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.080
common Windows services to determine if there's something running that shouldn't.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.960
For example, if there's a remote access program

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.370
allowing anyone to remotely login to the PC.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.890
The third potential area for Windows vulnerabilities is

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.700
unpatched software that contains known vulnerabilities.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:16.880
A common area for applying cybersecurity is with the windows and application updates.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.690
Recall from earlier lessons where you learned about vulnerability lists

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.300
found in the common vulnerabilities and enumeration or CVE list.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.480
On the Microsoft Security Resource Center,

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.425
MSRC, Security Update Guide.

00:02:31.425 --> 00:02:36.395
Malicious software is a continual threat for unpatched systems and applications.

00:02:36.395 --> 00:02:39.935
Other threats include unauthorized access to the system or data,

00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:41.945
or the disclosure of sensitive data.

00:02:41.945 --> 00:02:45.850
All of these mean headaches for security analysts.

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.490
How do we check a Windows PC to make sure it's up to date?

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.070
In the exercise, you'll get to explore that.
