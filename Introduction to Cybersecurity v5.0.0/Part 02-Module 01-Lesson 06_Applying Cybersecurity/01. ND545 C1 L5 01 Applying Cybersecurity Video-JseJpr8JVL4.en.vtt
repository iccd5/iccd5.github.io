00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.660
Welcome to the sixth lesson in this course,

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.320
where you will apply

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.045
the cybersecurity skills and knowledge you've been learning throughout the whole course.

00:00:09.045 --> 00:00:11.460
Learning theory is important to understand

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.645
the underlying reasons why we do what we do in cybersecurity.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:21.675
However, you need to be able to apply it in your home and work environment.

00:00:21.675 --> 00:00:24.990
This lesson and your subsequent project gives you

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.445
hands-on experience in assessing a sample Windows 10 operating system.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:31.395
Like you'll find in many businesses,

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:38.970
you have the opportunity to put your hacker hat on and apply real-life security defenses.
