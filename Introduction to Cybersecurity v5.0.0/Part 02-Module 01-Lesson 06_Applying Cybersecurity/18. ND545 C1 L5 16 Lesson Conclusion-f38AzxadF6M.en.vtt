This lesson explained the different ways to

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.300
establish and maintain the security of a network,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.000
operating systems, applications, or any devices that may be on the network.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.535
It's the final steps for applying cybersecurity on organizational computer systems.

00:00:17.535 --> 00:00:23.775
In this lesson, I covered identifying existing assets and devices on your network.

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:28.425
Analyzing those assets for vulnerabilities and threats that could harm them.

00:00:28.425 --> 00:00:34.570
