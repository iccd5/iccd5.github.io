00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
I'll now show you how to see if the Windows operating system

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.660
and its applications need any updates or patches.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.430
First, you need to make sure the Windows operating system is up to date

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.870
and it will automatically be updated when patches are available from Microsoft.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.255
To do that, you can go to the start bar and type update.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:24.060
You can click on the Check for Updates,

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.575
that will take you to the system settings update page.

00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:30.780
The Windows Update window will show you if

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:34.245
this PC needs any updates to the operating system.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:37.800
As you can see, this PC is up to date.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.680
If you really want to double-check,

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.925
you can click on the check for updates bar.

00:00:42.925 --> 00:00:44.455
At the bottom of the page,

00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:49.445
click on Advanced options to see the different options available for installing updates.

00:00:49.445 --> 00:00:56.045
For example, I can receive updates for other Microsoft products such as Word,

00:00:56.045 --> 00:00:59.120
Excel, PowerPoint when I update Windows,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:00.875
if they're already installed.

00:01:00.875 --> 00:01:03.185
If I'm using a slow internet connection,

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:06.860
I can select the meter option and I can

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.775
restart the device as soon as possible when a restart is required.

00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.475
Be careful when clicking on this because it can

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:17.095
accidentally restart when users are busy working.

00:01:17.095 --> 00:01:20.140
The second part that you want to make sure are up to

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.320
date are all applications on the system.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.185
To check the versions of applications,

00:01:26.185 --> 00:01:28.420
start with the control panel.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.160
In the control panel,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.950
select programs, and then click on Programs and features.

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.590
In the window that appears you see all of

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.499
the programs or applications that are installed,

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:46.450
their version number and when they were installed, and their publisher.

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.270
You can then check with the individual publisher to

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.505
see if there is a new version available from them.

00:01:52.505 --> 00:01:55.340
From the uninstall or change a program window,

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.060
you see all of the different programs that are installed on

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.315
this Windows PC along with their publisher when they were installed,

00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:04.760
their size, and then even the version number.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.550
You can go to the publisher's website to learn if there's

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.515
a more recent version that may have some security patches.

00:02:11.515 --> 00:02:17.799
To uninstall, you just would highlight whichever program and choose uninstall.

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:20.930
Often, applications will automatically update.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.540
Let me show you how this works within Chrome.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.605
In Chrome, we can see the version by clicking the three dots,

00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:32.115
going to Help and then About Google Chrome.

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:34.140
This will bring you to

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.455
the Google Chrome help page and tell you whether Google Chrome is up to date.

00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:44.215
Google Chrome is set by default to auto update, which is a good thing.

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:49.055
Double-check any browser you're on to make sure it's always up to date.

00:02:49.055 --> 00:02:53.860
Any vulnerabilities can lead to malware and data breaches.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.890
On Windows systems, the best practice is to use

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.315
an application like WSUS to automatically check for updates,

00:03:02.315 --> 00:03:04.505
download, and install them.

00:03:04.505 --> 00:03:07.580
Updating applications is one of the simplest,

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:13.470
most effective ways to stay up to date on security and privacy.
