00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
In previous lessons, you learned about the NIST and CIS

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:08.010
requirements for performing an asset inventory that includes any software,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.370
hardware, network devices, anything on the network that are a part of your business.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.505
You then took an inventory of your personal devices and then practice with a case study.

00:00:20.505 --> 00:00:24.570
In this lesson, we dive deep into the topic by reviewing

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.325
specific requirements and information about a target system.

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:33.690
This includes taking an inventory of all the installed applications,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.640
system configuration settings, and any policies affecting that system.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.165
How do you identify assets and devices on your network?

00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:44.930
Well, according to the CIS controls,

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.820
there are multiple options.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.030
You can use active or passive discovery tools

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.395
to identify devices on the organization's network.

00:00:53.395 --> 00:01:00.170
Active tools like the Nmap application can query a network range for all IP addresses,

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.280
giving you visibility as to what's on the network.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.970
Windows DHCP, Dynamic Host Control Protocol,

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.150
automatically distributes IP addresses when device attaches to a network.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.175
This is an example of a passive tool that collects

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:20.285
asset information that you can use as part of your asset inventory.

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:23.420
Many organizations also have a manual list of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.004
organizational assets and a database or a spreadsheet.

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:31.290
Another option on a network is port level access control,

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.145
that controls which devices can authenticate or attach to the network.

00:01:36.145 --> 00:01:38.015
Once you have an inventory,

00:01:38.015 --> 00:01:42.450
all organizations should address any unauthorized assets on the network.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.065
For example, bluetooth speakers like Google Home or Amazon Alexa.

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:51.400
Having too many applications are nightmare for maintenance and upkeep,

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.275
whether it's for a home system or your work.

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:58.060
Each needs to stay current on patches or else you risk getting

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.870
breached to when a vulnerability is exploited in an attack.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.105
How do you identify and control software programs used by your organization?

00:02:07.105 --> 00:02:11.320
Well, the CIS controls has a direction for that.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.465
Many organizations maintain a list of organizational assets and a database,

00:02:16.465 --> 00:02:22.030
a software inventory tool or Windows Server Update Services,

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.325
also known as WSUS or W SUS.

00:02:25.325 --> 00:02:30.875
WSUS captures information about Window systems and software on a corporate network.

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:36.280
It also is used to distribute patches on Windows systems and applications.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.895
The second step is to restrict who has administrator authority.

00:02:40.895 --> 00:02:44.420
In other words, who can install applications?

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.210
The risk is that employees will accidentally install

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.670
malicious software or an application that's in violation of the license agreement,

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.990
both put you and your organization in jeopardy.

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.445
The third task is to use application whitelisting.

00:03:01.445 --> 00:03:04.985
This is a list of what's allowed on your systems.

00:03:04.985 --> 00:03:10.820
Anything that's not on the list is automatically denied for being installed or used.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.970
For example, let's say you have a remote employee with

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.485
a company laptop that wants to install a game for their kids.

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:22.715
Of course, that should be denied not only because it's not for business use,

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:25.895
but it's also a potential security risk.

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:27.965
Like the hardware inventory,

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:32.030
make sure you address any unapproved software.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.730
More information on this topic is available from

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.970
the Center for Internet Security controls framework.
