00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
Remember the hacking life cycle?

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:06.600
Well, we're now into the fix it and make it better steps.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.210
This is where you make recommendations to reduce

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.810
the risks and apply appropriate security controls.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.190
In the previous step, you identified vulnerabilities and their corresponding threats.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.625
Basically, how a target or asset can be broken.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:25.110
Now, you need to make sure that you have protective or detective measures in

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.750
place to meet requirements and keep others from

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.065
breaking it either on purpose or even by accident.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.225
This can be done with technical settings,

00:00:33.225 --> 00:00:37.095
corporate policies, user training, or all three.

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:40.855
This video explains some sample recommendations.

00:00:40.855 --> 00:00:44.600
I'm often asked if there's a checklist of security recommendations.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.305
Throughout this course, I've introduced you to numerous ones.

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:51.560
For this step, I'll use the CIS controls for

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.965
guidance and how you should secure computer systems.

00:00:54.965 --> 00:01:01.355
I'll focus on the following CIS controls: continuous vulnerability management,

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:04.125
account monitoring and control.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:07.940
Basically know who's logged in and who has access,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.420
and then who has administrative privileges on the system,

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.275
administrator or root on Linux systems.

00:01:14.275 --> 00:01:20.255
We'll also look at secure configuration for both the hardware and software.

00:01:20.255 --> 00:01:24.469
Application software security is how do we secure

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.630
any applications on the system or even applications in development.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.405
We don't want to forget about security awareness and training.

00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:35.120
Basically informing all end users of

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.795
their expectations and best practices for cyber security.

00:01:38.795 --> 00:01:43.325
The first area of recommendations are to secure the configuration of software,

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:45.440
operating systems, and networks.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.555
This includes application security,

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:50.795
endpoint protection like antivirus and firewall,

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:53.005
and security policy settings.

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:55.220
Application security has a couple of

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.955
considerations which we looked at in previous videos.

00:01:58.955 --> 00:02:02.615
First is to remove any applications that are not needed.

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:05.285
That reduces the system's threat surface,

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:07.970
which means less things for hackers to attack.

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:12.160
For this, you should use the software inventory you created earlier.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.750
Second, for the remaining applications,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.200
make sure each one is up-to-date on its patches.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.180
The second area is endpoint protection.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.420
These are the defenses to protect your computer,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.035
such as anti-virus and other types of malware protection,

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:29.765
and also setting the computer's firewall.

00:02:29.765 --> 00:02:35.465
The third point is to set configuration policies on the system to further lock it down.

00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:38.540
This includes setting the Windows, auditing policies,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.130
and other security policies,

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.270
which I'll demonstrate in the exercise video.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:49.580
In previous videos, I talked about access control, authentication, and authorization.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:52.370
I have a couple of additional recommendations.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.955
The first is to ensure each account has an owner.

00:02:55.955 --> 00:02:58.940
This is the person responsible for the account.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.270
An account without an owner could be used to harm the computer,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.404
its data, or its contents.

00:03:04.404 --> 00:03:08.870
Second is to restrict users with administrative privileges.

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.475
These are accounts in the administrator's group that can do anything on the computer,

00:03:13.475 --> 00:03:18.025
including changing configuration settings and installing new applications.

00:03:18.025 --> 00:03:19.880
To all standard users,

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.790
the ability to perform administrative tasks,

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:28.175
Windows systems have a feature known as User Account Control or UAC.

00:03:28.175 --> 00:03:33.245
This restricts or allows what end-users can or cannot do on the computer.

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.930
The third recommendation I have is to implement

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.125
security awareness training for all users.

00:03:39.125 --> 00:03:42.860
This is the information they need to know to keep their systems,

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.370
applications, and data safe.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.150
Training would also include

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.380
the company policy rules we talked about in an earlier lesson.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.560
All users should receive security awareness training

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.460
throughout the year and verified at least annually.

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.430
Having a solid security awareness program reduces

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.700
many known security risks such as phishing,

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.160
malware, and data breaches.
