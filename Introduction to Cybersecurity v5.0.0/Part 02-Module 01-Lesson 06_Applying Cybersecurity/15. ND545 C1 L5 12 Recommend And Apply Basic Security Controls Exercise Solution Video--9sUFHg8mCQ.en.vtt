00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.455
Jill &amp; Roy's have many areas to prove their cybersecurity posture.

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:07.980
Below are just some of the sample answers such as reviewing

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.630
the user accounts and restrict administrative access on their Windows 10 system,

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.445
making sure all policies are set to include password policies,

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.280
get rid of any applications that are not needed.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.205
If you remember, maybe there were some games on the system.

00:00:23.205 --> 00:00:29.415
Ensuring the operating system and all applications stay up-to-date with their patches.

00:00:29.415 --> 00:00:32.570
You should also review the operating system services.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.010
Those are those little programs running in

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.770
the background on any type of operating system.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.475
Configure security settings within the local security policy.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:46.430
As you see, there's lots of settings you can enable on the local security policy.

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:49.820
So take some time to explore them and understand how they

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.710
can best be used to secure Jill &amp; Roy's computer system.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:56.740
Last, conduct security awareness,

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.900
training everyone on security best practices.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.500
Once these recommendations are approved by Jill &amp; Roy,

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.430
they can be implemented on their systems and throughout the company.
