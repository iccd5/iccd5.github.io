00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
I'll now show you how to apply some of the recommendations on a sample Windows 10 system.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.855
Let's start by looking at the system security settings.

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:12.690
To do this, open the control panel,

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.515
select System and Security.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.170
There's two areas you need to be aware of.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.155
First is the Windows Defender firewall.

00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:26.955
This is where you can turn on or turn off the Windows Defender firewall.

00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:30.690
I recommend just keep the default of on.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.905
Microsoft actually did a pretty good job in Windows 10 with their firewall.

00:00:34.905 --> 00:00:37.200
Leave it on for both the private networks,

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.760
that may be an internal network,

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.405
and then anytime the system may be on any guest or public networks like an open Wi-Fi.

00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:47.055
Also under System and Security,

00:00:47.055 --> 00:00:49.490
is Security and Maintenance.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.680
If we click on that,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.445
and then highlight the security drop-down,

00:00:55.445 --> 00:00:59.570
you will see we can also look at the network firewall here as well.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.885
We can change any Internet security settings and User Account Control.

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:07.950
Well first by looking at the virus protection.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.895
In the Windows virus and threat protection,

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:15.505
we can see if Windows Defender anti-virus is turned on by default,

00:01:15.505 --> 00:01:17.450
we can run a scan,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.955
see when it was last scanned,

00:01:19.955 --> 00:01:25.850
and if there are any threats or viruses known to Windows Defender on the system.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.820
Good news, everything is on and there are no virus or threats detected.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:39.470
Microsoft Defender, virus and threat protection is a good default option for many users.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.890
Now let's look at some of the local security policies available on Windows 10.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.980
Earlier, you saw the local security policy application.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:53.600
Going back there, you now should review the local policy settings,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.594
including the audit policy,

00:01:55.594 --> 00:01:58.765
user rights, assignment, and security options.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:01.039
Let's look at the local policies,

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.115
including the audit policy.

00:02:03.115 --> 00:02:07.940
The audit policy is where the computer logged whatever is happening.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:11.620
For example, if we want to turn on privilege use,

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.195
so anytime someone uses administrative privileges on this PC,

00:02:16.195 --> 00:02:17.685
it should be logged,

00:02:17.685 --> 00:02:21.405
whether it's a success or a failure.

00:02:21.405 --> 00:02:26.390
You can click on the Explain tab to learn more about this option.

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.650
To change the security setting for this audit privilege,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.035
you just need to click on the check boxes.

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:36.050
So I'm going to turn on both success and failure,

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.305
click OK, and you see this is now available as a security setting.

00:02:41.305 --> 00:02:43.250
User Rights Assignment allows

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.960
the granular setting of what each user account is permitted to do.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.990
As you can see, there are many options.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.125
I recommend you take some time to review these,

00:02:54.125 --> 00:03:00.500
change them as needed based on your security policy for your organization.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.335
Security options has a list of additional configuration options for the operating system.

00:03:06.335 --> 00:03:10.460
For example, if you want to set specific logon hours and

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.525
have the machine automatically log off when they expire,

00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:16.385
you can use this option.

00:03:16.385 --> 00:03:20.885
There's many other options available under security options.

00:03:20.885 --> 00:03:22.975
Take some time to understand them.

00:03:22.975 --> 00:03:25.460
The last security setting you should configure on

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.150
this Windows 10 PC is User Account Control or the, UAC setting.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.515
To do this, go to the start bar,

00:03:33.515 --> 00:03:35.285
when I just type UAC,

00:03:35.285 --> 00:03:39.475
it automatically knows I want to change the user account settings.

00:03:39.475 --> 00:03:42.730
Going into User Account Control Settings,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.770
this is where you determine how

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.985
the user can use administrative privileges on this local PC.

00:03:49.985 --> 00:03:54.245
You'll see here right now it's going to never notify when

00:03:54.245 --> 00:03:58.520
any changes are made on the system using administrative authority.

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:02.935
This is a very dangerous setting and is not recommended.

00:04:02.935 --> 00:04:07.160
I recommend using the default setting to notify

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.375
whenever any applications try to make changes to this computer.

00:04:11.375 --> 00:04:12.815
To make the change,

00:04:12.815 --> 00:04:19.265
click OK. Now the user account control setting is in place.

00:04:19.265 --> 00:04:24.400
There are many security options and settings you can have on a Windows 10 PC.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.190
You can find most of them simply through the control panel.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.390
I encourage you to use this as an opportunity to learn more about

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.790
Windows 10 security because this will help

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.520
you across many other different types of systems.
