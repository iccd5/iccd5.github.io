00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.980
In this lesson, you will see methods for

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.965
establishing and maintaining the security of a network,

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:09.385
computing environment and all of the applications residing on it.

00:00:09.385 --> 00:00:14.130
Throughout the lesson, you will apply your security knowledge to identify assets,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.520
applications and system settings on computer systems,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.920
analyze vulnerabilities and threats to

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.160
that target system and recommend and apply basic security controls.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.750
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.570
you'll be able to categorize the asset, risks,

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.630
threats, vulnerabilities and exploits.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.740
Identify organizational assets,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.430
analyze vulnerabilities and risks to those organizational assets,

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.689
and recommend and apply basic security controls.

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:47.610
Let's dive into this lesson.
