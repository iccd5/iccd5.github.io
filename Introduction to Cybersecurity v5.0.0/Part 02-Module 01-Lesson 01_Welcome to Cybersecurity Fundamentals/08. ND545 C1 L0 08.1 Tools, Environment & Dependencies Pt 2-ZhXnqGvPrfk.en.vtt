00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
The last tool I want to show you is called 7-Zip.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.760
It's normally used to compress files, make them smaller.

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.740
You can also use it to encrypt.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:10.925
Let me show you.

00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:13.805
I created a folder, just called Files.

00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.815
I already have downloaded and installed 7-Zip,

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.825
which is freely available.

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:25.950
To encrypt, all I need to do is I right-click on the folder, "Add to archive".

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:29.340
The 7-Zip application will then open,

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.340
and I can name the archive.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.485
I can change the compression rate.

00:00:34.485 --> 00:00:35.960
This is really what I want to show you,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.510
is I can now password protect this file.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.125
I can call it whatever I want.

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:48.890
This is just a very simple way to encrypt files using the AES-256 encryption method.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.605
This is the advanced encryption standard

00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:54.595
from the National Institute of Standards and Technology,

00:00:54.595 --> 00:00:57.665
and it has a 256-bit length,

00:00:57.665 --> 00:01:00.110
meaning it's pretty strong encryption,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.275
fairly hard to crack.

00:01:02.275 --> 00:01:07.129
This is a very easy way though to encrypt files.

00:01:07.129 --> 00:01:10.130
I'll then send the encrypted file over the Internet,

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.485
say through email, and then give the person the password through another means.

00:01:14.485 --> 00:01:17.150
Consider using 7-Zip just as

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:22.690
an easy way to use encryption of files that may contain some sensitive data.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.715
Once I click "OK",

00:01:24.715 --> 00:01:30.155
there's now an encrypted folder on my desktop, that's an archive.

00:01:30.155 --> 00:01:32.570
To extract the folder's contents,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.825
I'll have to put in the password.

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:37.050
There's one last tool.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.470
I'd be remiss if I didn't talk to you about,

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.545
because it's the number one tool used by hackers worldwide,

00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:44.000
both the white hat good type,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.715
black hat bad type.

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:47.475
It's simply Google.

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:50.075
We're always googling for answers.

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.010
You can't know everything,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.805
but it's more important to know where to find information.

00:01:55.805 --> 00:02:01.595
Google is very powerful in terms of what it can find across the Internet.

00:02:01.595 --> 00:02:06.410
One part I want to show you is the advanced search within Google,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.120
google.com/advanced_search, where now you can search

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:16.820
for all word or an exact phrase, or any word.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.170
You can change language,

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.680
look for a particular region on a specific domain.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:31.030
If I wanted to find everything about cybersecurity at udacity.com,

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.970
click the "Advanced Search",

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.940
and this is now showing me just the results at Udacity for cybersecurity.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.120
No other websites.

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.525
The Google Advanced Search should be on one of the top sites you visit daily,

00:02:50.525 --> 00:02:53.300
as part of your hacking lifecycle,

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.660
and as you're expanding your knowledge of cybersecurity.
