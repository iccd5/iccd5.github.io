00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
Hi. I'm Ron, and I'm your instructor for this class.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.505
Yes, I'm a hacker,

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:07.380
but I'm actually one of the good kinds.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.480
I have a white hat, not a black hat,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.795
because I just really dig IT and cybersecurity.

00:00:12.795 --> 00:00:16.405
You see, I've been doing it for well over 20 years.

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:21.270
I'm the president of my own cybersecurity consulting company, Cyber-AAA,

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.340
and I'm also a university professor at Bellevue University,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.700
where I've been teaching for over 10 years.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:34.255
I'm a noted security writer, blogger, podcaster, videographer.

00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:36.095
I really dig, just getting out,

00:00:36.095 --> 00:00:38.390
meeting new people like yourself,

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.180
and teaching you about cybersecurity,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.750
so please connect with me on Twitter and LinkedIn.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.240
I'm really excited to get started in this course,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.710
so let's get rolling.
