00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Many people assume that cybersecurity is new,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.105
relatively starting within the last few decades.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:11.025
However, cybersecurity history dates back to the late 1960s,

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:14.070
before people even had a computer.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.340
With the start of the Internet in the 1960s,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.884
known as the ARPANET,

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:21.240
came a need to secure the data connections,

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.310
computer systems for those using it,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.285
mostly research institutions, universities, and governments.

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:30.960
Computers in the early days of the Internet often didn't have

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.590
basic protection and used telephone modems to dial into the network.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.935
Many of the early computer attacks started as experiments.

00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:44.150
In 1971, Bob Thompson made history by

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.485
creating a program that is widely accepted as the first ever computer worm.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.740
The worm bounced between computers and wasn't harmful.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.015
However, it would display a message on any infected system saying,

00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:58.405
"I'm a creeper, catch me if you can".

00:00:58.405 --> 00:01:03.045
In 1986, the first computer virus for MS-DOS,

00:01:03.045 --> 00:01:06.405
known as the brain was released.

00:01:06.405 --> 00:01:11.000
In 1989, Robert Morris created a computer worm that's considered the first

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.025
Denial of Service or DOS attack to highlight Unix security issues.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:18.180
In May 2000, the,

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.230
ILOVEYOU virus written in VBScript and using social engineering techniques,

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:29.905
infected millions of Windows computers worldwide within a few hours of its release.

00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:32.615
Lastly, in 2010, Stuxnet,

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:37.225
a Windows Trojan that attacks SCADA systems, was detected.

00:01:37.225 --> 00:01:41.540
All of the malicious activity caused the advent of computer security,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.895
also known as information security, and now cybersecurity.

00:01:45.895 --> 00:01:50.870
Two computer scientists realized the need for rules to govern these new computer systems.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.570
In 1975, Jerome Saltzer and

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.560
Michael Schroeder published the Protection of Information in Computer Systems,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.360
which is still used today.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.100
The first US patent for cybersecurity came in September of 1983,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.174
when MIT was granted a patent for introducing

00:02:07.174 --> 00:02:12.739
the RSA Rivest-Shamir-Adleman cryptographic algorithm,

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:16.775
which was one of the first public key cryptosystems.

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:21.395
Around 1986, Clifford Stoll, a Berkeley astronomer,

00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:23.480
caught a German hacker working for

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:28.130
the Soviet Union trying to break into US government computers on the Internet.

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:29.900
He wrote about it in his book,

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.920
The Cuckoo's Egg, a must read in cybersecurity.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.480
Around that same time,

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.900
the US government enacted the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.900
the United Kingdom Government realized it needed

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.810
to strengthen its laws regarding computer use.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.555
So in 1990, the Computer Misuse Act was passed,

00:02:49.555 --> 00:02:52.830
and in 2001, NIST chose

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.750
the Rijndael encryption algorithm to be the Advanced Encryption Standard,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.310
which is still used today.
