00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.845
This course finishes with a project where you get to practice your hands-on

00:00:04.845 --> 00:00:11.550
hacking skills and cybersecurity knowledge using a case study based on real-life events.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.324
In the project, you'll be given a scenario,

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:18.960
where you're asked to help a friend secure his business's Windows 10 PC.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.860
You'll need to apply what you've learned throughout the course to lock

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.835
it down so only authorized users can be on it.

00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:30.690
You also need to make sure only applications needed will be running.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.095
Lastly, there's a fun computer forensics challenge,

00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:38.755
where you'll need to determine what bad guys were doing on the computer.

00:00:38.755 --> 00:00:42.965
You'll be documenting all of this in your course report,

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:44.960
just like the one that I prepare for

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.550
my clients when I'm performing security assessments for them.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.980
It's meant to be a fun way to get you hands-on cybersecurity experience.
