00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.165
Let's walk through a scenario for defense in depth

00:00:03.165 --> 00:00:06.810
and see what layers we can identify that will need addressing.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.730
Put your thinking cap on and let's get to it.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.465
It's natural to focus on big picture

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:15.075
when it comes to defense in depth and layered security.

00:00:15.075 --> 00:00:16.560
So for this scenario,

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.645
let's drill in a little deeper.

00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:21.655
We're looking at a typical web server.

00:00:21.655 --> 00:00:27.455
It is open to the public Internet and it does manage some customer information.

00:00:27.455 --> 00:00:31.055
What are several things that come to mind that will need addressing?

00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:34.820
We know that being a web server open to the Internet,

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.070
traffic to it should be restricted to

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.560
just Internet-related ports such as 80 in 443 and the firewall.

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.100
This would be an excellent opportunity to use the host based firewall as well.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.070
Depending on whether it is Windows or Linux,

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.300
we could disable unnecessary services or daemons.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.760
Check the permissions on all accounts, files,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.450
and directories required using the principle of least privilege.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.460
Determine if the machine has the proper patches installed.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.835
Every website has a database.

00:01:05.835 --> 00:01:08.070
Is the connection secure and are

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.660
the account's privileges appropriate for the needed access?

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.150
Are the files and disks encrypted on the server as well as the database?

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.440
Is monitoring enabled to alert on anomalies as well as performance issues?

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.709
As you can see at just a cursory glance,

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.700
we came up with eight layers of security for a single web host.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.430
Take your time, take good notes,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.530
and you will be implementing defense in depth

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.600
in your own organization before you know it.
