00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
To illustrate that least privilege does not apply just to computer permissions,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.980
let's take a look at a scenario for physical controls.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.900
A major part of gaining valuable experience in college comes from internships.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.180
Every summer, thousands of college students fan out across the country into experience,

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.205
and connection making internships.

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.890
In this example, our student will be spending

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.575
the summer at an organization and a heavily regulated industry.

00:00:26.575 --> 00:00:30.905
They will be performing their work in a high-rise building in a major city.

00:00:30.905 --> 00:00:34.535
Because this organization is subject to heavy regulation,

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:37.025
they have a strong physical security program

00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:39.995
to protect their intellectual property, and customer data.

00:00:39.995 --> 00:00:43.720
They use proximity cards for access throughout the facility.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.935
They have a robust scheduling component as a feature of their security program.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:50.420
It is integrated into

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.915
their collaboration portal so managers can make real-time adjustments.

00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:58.030
The interns work schedule is 10:00-4:00 Monday through Friday.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.680
Their card will only allow them to utilize

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.055
the parking deck one hour before to one hour after.

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:08.645
Lobby access is also limited to a marginally expanded workday.

00:01:08.645 --> 00:01:11.810
The elevators require card access to enter,

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.130
and will only allow approved floor selection,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.985
and after hours will only travel to the lobby.

00:01:16.985 --> 00:01:20.110
Stairwells have the same access as the elevators.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.270
The lobby is always open for fire escape purposes.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.810
Within the floor the intern will be working in,

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.810
they will only have access to the department to which they are assigned.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.635
As you can see, by implementing the principle of least privilege,

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:39.300
the organization has greatly decreased the likelihood of unauthorized physical access.
