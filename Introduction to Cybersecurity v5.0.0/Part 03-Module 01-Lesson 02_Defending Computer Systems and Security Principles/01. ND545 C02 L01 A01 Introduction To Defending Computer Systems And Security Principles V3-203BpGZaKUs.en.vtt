Welcome to defending and securing systems.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:06.210
I hope you're ready to dig in and learn about the principles of cybersecurity,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.565
as well as the philosophy behind the way we work.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:10.845
Grab a notepad, take good notes,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:14.895
and you'll be well on your way to learning the skills it takes to work in cybersecurity.

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:16.755
By the close of this lesson,

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:19.875
you'll have a working knowledge of defense in depth,

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.245
