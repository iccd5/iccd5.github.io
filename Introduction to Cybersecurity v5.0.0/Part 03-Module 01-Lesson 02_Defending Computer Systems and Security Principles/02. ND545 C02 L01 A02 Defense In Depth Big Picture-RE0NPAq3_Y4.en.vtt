00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
Why do security principles matter?

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.345
In courtrooms, judges often look for precedence.

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:09.060
Cases with similar characteristics as

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.390
their current one that had been adjudicated in the past.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.215
While they make up their own mind based on the facts and the law,

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:20.155
they use those prior cases as reference points and frameworks.

00:00:20.155 --> 00:00:23.030
The cybersecurity profession is no different.

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:25.440
Why reinvent the wheel when you can

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.530
use other proven sources to build your security program?

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.315
Every organization is different, even within industries.

00:00:32.315 --> 00:00:34.310
In building your security program,

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.295
you will reference many sources.

00:00:36.295 --> 00:00:41.030
For this course, we will use three primary categories of sources,

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.715
frameworks and best practices,

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:48.350
vendor documentation and regulatory requirements.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.485
First up, frameworks and best practices.

00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:55.145
A framework is a set of agreed upon policies,

00:00:55.145 --> 00:00:59.680
procedures, and processes that define how information is managed.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.180
There are hundreds of security frameworks.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.850
But for this course, we'll primarily use NIST,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.879
the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:11.015
Best practices are very similar in nature.

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:14.030
They are procedures and processes that are

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.290
widely accepted within an industry as being effective.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:22.220
The primary difference is a framework is an official document with controls on how it

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.335
is modified and best practices are generally more organically created and maintained.

00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:30.140
Next is vendor documentation.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.440
Vendor documentation is a combination of

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.335
requirements and suggestions for the specific security configuration of their product.

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:42.125
An example would be Microsoft Server Security Guide.

00:01:42.125 --> 00:01:45.935
It contains advice and recommendations on updates,

00:01:45.935 --> 00:01:49.540
security settings, identity management, and much more.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.195
Before implementing a new application or a piece of hardware,

00:01:53.195 --> 00:01:56.645
be sure you have reviewed all the appropriate documentation.

00:01:56.645 --> 00:02:00.560
If your organization is subject to regulatory compliance,

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.980
such as FERPA, HIPAA,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.805
or PCI, there will certainly be documentation in the form of requirements,

00:02:07.805 --> 00:02:12.210
best practices, and recommendations for your security program.
