00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's take a look at a sample NIST 800 standard

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.600
together and see how it could aid in setting up our security program.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.165
In Google, type NIST 880-83 Revision 1.

00:00:12.165 --> 00:00:15.645
The first thing I like to do is check the date published.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:17.010
This is a little old,

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.130
but if you notice, it is the most current version.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.840
Click "Local Download" and here we are.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.270
This particular standard is the Guide to

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.185
Malware Incident Prevention and Handling for Desktops and Laptops.

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:34.340
This standard gives information on terminology associated with malware,

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.750
such as viruses, worms,

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.125
and Trojans, the tools an attacker may use,

00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.760
including information on mitigating malware.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.050
It gives advice on defensive tools such as antivirus,

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.050
IDS, IPS, firewalls, and etc.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.590
This standard will come in handy when creating your anti-malware strategy.
