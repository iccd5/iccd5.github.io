00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.324
In continuing with security principles,

00:00:02.324 --> 00:00:04.830
we're turning our attention to the NIST framework.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.860
We'll learn how to apply the recommendations included

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.445
within the framework to our organizations security program.

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:13.305
By the end of this section,

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:15.495
you'll understand what NIST is,

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:18.135
we'll review several sample standards.

00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:23.775
Finally, we'll compare the NIST 800 standards with the NIST cybersecurity framework.

00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:28.005
Where does NIST fit in our three component model of security,

00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.780
primarily in prevention and detection.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.435
So what exactly is NIST?

00:00:33.435 --> 00:00:37.684
NIST is the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

00:00:37.684 --> 00:00:40.190
It was founded in 1901 to help

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.660
the US industrial sector standardize technology, metrics and measurements.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.490
It has since been expanded to include thousands of standards relating to computers,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.930
nuclear, AI, and many other technologies.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.540
NIST compliance is mandatory for many federal contracts.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:58.430
It is such a ubiquitous standard to

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.325
many commercial contracts including the framework as well.

00:01:01.325 --> 00:01:06.020
For this course, we'll be focusing on standards within the NIST 800 framework,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.445
but also taking a look at the NIST cybersecurity framework.

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:11.340
Let's look at a few examples.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.400
As stated before, there are many NIST standards that apply to cyber security.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.535
We're going to be taking a look at three sample standards.

00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:22.220
Remember, you use standards as guides to

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.760
assist in setting up the various components of your security program.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:31.015
Let's kick things off with NIST 800-41 Revision 1,

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:33.050
one of the standards for firewalls.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.055
It includes information on firewall types and technologies,

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:38.855
which we'll visit in lesson 2.

00:01:38.855 --> 00:01:45.100
It provides network design examples and recommendations via high-level network layouts.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.570
The standard provides terminology and

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.409
information regarding access control in networking protocols.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:54.020
Finally, it gives advice on planning

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.680
your firewall implementation by consulting the standard,

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.060
as well as manufacturer documentation when architecting your edge defenses,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.675
you are developing a formidable layer in your defensive layout.

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:12.105
The next example is the 800-123 General Server Security Standard.

00:02:12.105 --> 00:02:15.875
While this particular example is considered a legacy standard,

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.905
it is worth visiting for the principles contained in it.

00:02:18.905 --> 00:02:23.540
Use it when discussing server implementation at a conceptual level.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.760
Specifically, it contains valuable information for server vulnerabilities and threats,

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.210
as well as acting as a guide for categorizing what level

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.140
of risk a particular server may represent given its purpose.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.420
Next, it has considerations for deploying your server in terms of datatypes,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.975
applications, and network requirements.

00:02:44.975 --> 00:02:51.334
800-123 also offers recommendations on security controls from physical,

00:02:51.334 --> 00:02:53.675
to logins, to security updates.

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:58.535
Finally, the standard gives recommendations on logging and monitoring.

00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:01.040
Remember, this standard is not

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.910
a procedure in that it does not provide specific instructions.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.855
Rather, it offers valuable insights in the form of server security principles.

00:03:10.855 --> 00:03:18.520
The final NIST 800 example we'll learn about is 800-175B, Revision 1.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.995
If your organization is considering implementing encryption,

00:03:21.995 --> 00:03:24.865
this standard will provide valuable insight.

00:03:24.865 --> 00:03:27.735
This standard provides important terminology,

00:03:27.735 --> 00:03:32.960
as well as offers technical specification from the IEEE and IETF,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.875
that's Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:39.814
and Internet Engineering Task Force, respectively.

00:03:39.814 --> 00:03:45.830
It provides high-level technical explanations on technologies such as cryptography,

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.995
hash generation, and verification.

00:03:48.995 --> 00:03:51.050
Finally, the standard offers

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.325
valuable information and recommendations on Key Generation and Management.

00:03:55.325 --> 00:03:59.870
Now, we're turning our attention to the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.100
The CSF was created in 2014,

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.875
and Version 1.1 was released in 2018.

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:12.649
It is a high level document aimed at the executive level of industries and governments.

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:15.980
What are some items included in the Cybersecurity Framework?

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.285
Strategies for identity management, risk assessments,

00:04:20.285 --> 00:04:22.790
managing security in the supply chain,

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.460
and vulnerability disclosures and more.

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.185
How do you use the CSF?

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:31.685
First, you determine what your security profile is.

00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:36.410
That means, is your company at the forefront of being proactive about security?

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.725
Or do you typically wait and react when an event occurs?

00:04:39.725 --> 00:04:43.460
Ideally, you want to be more proactive and less reactive.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.400
At this point, you're ready for a risk assessment.

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.785
Many organizations began with a self-assessment to resolve any obvious discrepancies.

00:04:51.785 --> 00:04:53.660
But to get a clear understanding,

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.225
it's best to consult an outside vendor.

00:04:56.225 --> 00:04:57.815
The vendor will produce

00:04:57.815 --> 00:05:02.480
a post assessment report that will include a list of gaps and your security.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.130
Often these will be categorized from critical to simple recommendation.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:10.400
You'll want to analyze this report with your management team.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.865
Once the report has been analyzed and priorities are set,

00:05:13.865 --> 00:05:17.690
you develop a plan of action to remedy the findings and start again.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.640
So which should you use?

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.430
The NIST 800 framework or the Cybersecurity Framework? Use both.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:29.660
The NIST 800 standards are more practical and offer specific recommendations to secure

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:32.540
your organization while the CSF is a

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.810
bit more theoretical and is aimed at the leadership level.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.270
Using both will allow you to explain to

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.410
the executive team how your security tactics align with their strategy.
