You've made it to the end of the threats vulnerabilities as an Internet response course.

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:08.790
At this point, you know how to assess threats,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.975
including identifying threat actors and creating threat profiles.

00:00:12.975 --> 00:00:17.820
You learned how to find security vulnerabilities that threat actors may try to

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.670
exploit as well as how to use industry resources like MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.785
You also learned how to launch

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:31.035
a vulnerability scan and even cracked a few passwords as a part of penetration testing.

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:33.525
So many great skills acquired here.

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:35.880
During the second half of the course,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.410
you got introduced to the ins and outs of planning for remediation.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.735
You learned about how to calculate CVSS severity scores,

00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:48.695
how to leverage the MITRE CVE framework to research vulnerabilities,

00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:54.790
and consider various factors as you prioritize findings, and finally,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.760
you learned about the incident response process and planning,

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.550
and recognizing indicators of compromise as well as the importance of digital forensics.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.750
You even searched for clues to unmask a planned heist in the lab environment.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.075
You've done so much and without a doubt,

00:01:11.075 --> 00:01:15.740
these are essential skills that companies need in order to remain secure.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.030
Congratulations on completing the course and best wishes along your journey.
