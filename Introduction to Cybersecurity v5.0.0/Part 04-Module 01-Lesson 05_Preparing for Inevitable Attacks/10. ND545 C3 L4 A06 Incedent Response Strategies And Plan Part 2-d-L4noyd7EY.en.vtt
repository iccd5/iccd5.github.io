00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
I found myself in a situation early in my career where I got

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:09.870
a notification that looked like a potential indicator of compromise.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.200
An application system went offline and users couldn't access it for a few hours,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.660
and then it came back up all of a sudden.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.985
Now, could this be an event?

00:00:20.985 --> 00:00:24.330
Could this be an incident? I had to explore?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.310
So I had to think through possibilities and also do some research by looking through

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.645
logs and detection systems and more to figure out what might be going on.

00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:39.130
Well, it turns out the system was offline for routine updates,

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.560
but some users just didn't see the email,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.004
and because it's routine maintenance,

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:46.400
it's not an incident,

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.735
it's more of an event.

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:50.600
However, if in this example,

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.400
I found that it was degraded because it was being hit with fake traffic,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.975
for example or there was

00:00:56.975 --> 00:01:01.115
a sketchy process running that was eating up all of the CPU power,

00:01:01.115 --> 00:01:03.445
that could be considered an incident.

00:01:03.445 --> 00:01:08.194
So in summary, an indicator of compromise can help you distinguish

00:01:08.194 --> 00:01:11.000
an event from an incident in order to

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.450
determine if you should activate your incident response plan.
