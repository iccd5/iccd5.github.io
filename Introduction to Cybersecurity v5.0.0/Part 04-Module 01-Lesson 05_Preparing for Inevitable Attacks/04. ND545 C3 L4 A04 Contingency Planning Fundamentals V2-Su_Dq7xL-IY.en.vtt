00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.425
Infinite response is a subset of contingency planning.

00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.135
Before we dig into that,

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:08.100
let's cover some basics.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.725
Contingency planning is the process of preparing a company to detect,

00:00:13.725 --> 00:00:17.730
react to, and recover from threats to assets.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.585
The main goal is to bring the company back to a state

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:26.055
of normal operations following a disruptive event.

00:00:26.055 --> 00:00:28.620
As seen in many events,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.820
including the hurricanes in the US in the past that forced 1,000

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.720
patients to relocate to other hospitals in order to get treatment.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.730
Unfortunately, in that situation,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:47.570
12 people lost their lives in a facility that lost power as a part of that incident.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.845
This is a true testament to the importance of contingency planning and having backups.

00:00:53.845 --> 00:00:58.145
There are three key parts to contingency planning that I'll walk you through.

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:04.460
Now, let's dig right in. The first key part of contingency planning is incident response.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.210
Incident response is the process of detecting and

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.015
responding to limit consequences of a malicious,

00:01:13.015 --> 00:01:19.880
unintentional or circumstantial cyber attack against an organization's systems.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.030
This is triggered when there is an adverse event,

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.065
like a loss of access or detection of intrusion that has been declared an incident.

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:34.895
The next key part of contingency planning is business continuity.

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:38.300
Business continuity is a predetermined process

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.465
that describes how an organization's mission

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:48.790
and business processes will be sustained during and after a significant disruption.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.055
The main goal of business continuity is to keep the organization running even if

00:01:55.055 --> 00:02:01.790
it's at an alternate site or at a reduced capacity until things can be fully restored.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.115
The final key part of contingency planning is disaster recovery.

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:11.704
Disaster recovery is a predetermined process that details

00:02:11.704 --> 00:02:17.135
how critical applications and processes will be restored to

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:22.685
normal operations typically at the primary business site in the event of

00:02:22.685 --> 00:02:29.045
a major hardware or software failure or if there is destruction of facilities.

00:02:29.045 --> 00:02:34.745
The main goal here is to completely recover and bring things back to normal.

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:38.090
Another important element to note is that each of

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.490
the three contingency planning components is driven by business impact analysis,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.300
which is a fundamental part of contingency planning that discloses

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.860
how adverse threats can impact company assets in the first place.
