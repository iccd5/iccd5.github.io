00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550
Digital forensics is relevant at all stages of the incident response life cycle.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.860
During the preparation phase,

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:13.395
having a plan and resources lined up in case you need digital forensics is key.

00:00:13.395 --> 00:00:19.770
Also during the middle steps of detection, analysis, containment,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.030
eradication and recovery, digital forensics can help

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:30.180
incident teams understand what has happened during an incident in order to manage it.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.380
Finally, where this is most heavily used is in the post-incident activity.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.460
The point of digital forensics is all about evidence and so if

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.165
you plan to pursue legal or other actions,

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:45.980
especially after a breach,

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.395
digital forensics is critical.

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:52.415
Digital forensics helps shed light on what happened.

00:00:52.415 --> 00:00:54.845
What did the attacker access?

00:00:54.845 --> 00:00:56.720
What actions did they take?

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.415
How can you prove this?

00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.970
So the process involves identifying,

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.985
preserving, analyzing, and reporting on evidence.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:10.370
First is identifying.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.760
This is the practice of finding and collecting

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.255
the suspected original source or assets believed to contain evidence.

00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:22.670
For example, an investigator may pinpoint

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.285
suspicious activity from an IP address that's assigned to an employee's laptop.

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:31.475
So the digital forensics investigator may have

00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:36.095
a co-worker send them the suspected laptop for analysis.

00:01:36.095 --> 00:01:38.190
Next is preserving.

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.570
This is the practice of ensuring the integrity of

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.015
the collected evidence and preserving a digital trail of the data or media.

00:01:47.015 --> 00:01:51.875
For example, it's essential to monitor how assets and

00:01:51.875 --> 00:01:57.304
any copies of data have been handled since being taken from the environment,

00:01:57.304 --> 00:01:59.665
along with who had access.

00:01:59.665 --> 00:02:03.964
You can also monitor tampering with official seals,

00:02:03.964 --> 00:02:08.675
file hashing, and other means to help check integrity.

00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:13.340
This also includes making sure that evidence isn't destroyed through

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.995
adverse conditions such as overheating or water moisture damage.

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:20.770
Then comes analyzing.

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.440
This is the investigative portion of

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.670
the process where a forensics expert begins to look into

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.270
the acquired assets or the media's data to find

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.330
evidence of the suspected crime or incident that has happened.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.645
For example, the investigator may look through documents,

00:02:40.645 --> 00:02:43.660
e-mails, and chat conversations,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.365
browser website history, hard drives,

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:52.555
downloads on the computer and other user activities to find more clues.

00:02:52.555 --> 00:02:56.120
Finally, you do reporting.

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.890
This is the process of creating a report of findings from

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.825
the investigation for presentation to stakeholders and in some cases,

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:08.335
an attorney or jury in court.

00:03:08.335 --> 00:03:12.600
Reporting has to be tailored to the audience.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.805
In a court case where the jury is not technically savvy,

00:03:16.805 --> 00:03:22.204
findings should be explained in a way that are easy to understand for everyone

00:03:22.204 --> 00:03:28.300
because failure to do so could make even the most incriminating evidence ineffective.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.550
Those are the four steps in the digital forensics process.
