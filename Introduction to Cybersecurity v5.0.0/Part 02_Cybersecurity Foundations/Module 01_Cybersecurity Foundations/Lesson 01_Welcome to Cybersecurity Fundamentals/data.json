What is Cybersecurity: this lesson will go over some security trends and how to take the first step to set a career in the field.\n2. Maintaining a Secure Infrastructure: this lesson will cover important security regulations, laws, and frameworks you need to know to maintain a secure infrastructure.\n3. Thinking like a Hacker: this lesson will give you a high-level introduction to the hacking lifecycle, risk, vulnerability, and threat.\n4. Security Defenses: this lesson will cover some skills to keep your computer and network safe.\n5. Applying Cybersecurity: this lesson will give you an opportunity to apply the fundamental skills you have learned.\n\nThe **first three lessons** cover many conceptual topics that will help you set a foundation for cybersecurity and for the final project. In the **last two lessons**, you will have more hands-on opportunities to practice how to secure a system. Throughout the course, you will be provided with many exercises. Some of them introduce you to useful websites and documents that you may use in your future career, some of them will let you apply what you have learned from the course and prepare you for the final project. Hope you will enjoy the course!",

With all this technology, comes risks and dangers. \n* What if someone was able to gain access to your computers, accounts, and sensitive data? \n* How much damage could they do? \n* What do we need to do to secure our technologies? \n\nIt’s up to each of us to do our part in securing our cyber world. Failure to do so not only affects you but the world, businesses, and people around you. A single moment where you unconsciously click a link could take down your organization. <br> Learning how to protect yourself better online may be one reason you’re in this course.\n\nAnother reason may be to get employed in a cybersecurity career. According to the [Security Magazine](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/92312-of-cybersecurity-leaders-face-skills-shortage), 76% of security leaders believe there is a shortage of cybersecurity skills. That means there are many opportunities for cybersecurity professionals. \n\n",

Whether an organization is thinking of adopting cloud computing or just using email and maintaining a website, cybersecurity should be a part of the plan. Theft of digital information has become the most commonly reported fraud, surpassing physical theft. Every business that uses the Internet is responsible for creating a culture of security that will enhance business and consumer confidence.\"\n\nHere are some of the topics related to business protection that we’ll cover in this class:\n* Cybersecurity basics, \n* Understanding the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, \n* Physical Security, \n* Attacks such as ransomware and phishing, \n* Email security, and \n* Securing remote access. \n\nThe [US Federal Trade Commission website](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/small-businesses/cybersecurity) on cybersecurity for small business provides information all businesses need to know to protect their technologies, data, and people from cyber attacks. This is more evidence of the importance of cybersecurity for business. Consider this website as a resource not only in this course and Nanodegree, but throughout your professional career.",

It’s okay if you don’t have one to use as we’ll give you access to one.\nMost Windows operating systems come with built-in security tools. Some of the Windows components you’ll use are:\n* The Control Panel\n* Computer Management\n* Local Security Policies\n\nThere are also other tools that help you as a cybersecurity professional. These include:\n* Sysinternals Suite\n* Windows God Mode\n* NMap - network mapper\n* 7-Zip\n\nThe number 1 tool you’ll use is Google. We use it to help find information on any topic.\n\nLastly, you’ll be exploring numerous websites that provide specific information about security topics such as the largest cyber breaches, software vulnerabilities, and security standards. \n\nDon't be overwhelmed by so many tools. We will walk you through in subsequent lessons when you need to use them.\n",
