He suspects that others may have broken into his PC and could be using it to transfer files across the internet. He has asked that you secure it for him according to industry best practices, so it can be once again used as a standard PC.  \n\nYou will be given access to a virtual image of **Joe’s Auto Body’s PC**. It’s a copy of the actual computer operating system in use that will be transferred to Joe’s computer once you are done. You will also be given a **document template** that contains the high-level steps you’ll need to take as part of securing a typical computer system. For each step, you need to write your answers in the document template, explain how you got the answers, and provide screenshots showing your work. \n\n## Submission Checklist\nBefore you submit, check if the following have been completed:  \n\n|    | |\n|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| <input type=\"checkbox\"> | Everything in the [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/2857/view) is in the document. |\n| <input type=\"checkbox\"> | Final review of document for completion, typos, clarity, name, date, etc. |\n| <input type=\"checkbox\"> | The document is in the form of a PDF and is still correctly formatted.  |\n| <input type=\"checkbox\"> | The PDF file's name should include your name to make it unique.|\n| | | |\n\n## Ready to Submit?\nOnce you have all the items above completed, you can click the submit button.

This project gives you the opportunity to apply what you’ve learned in the course by investigating a Windows 10 PC, securing it, and then explaining what you found and did in your security report. The same skills you use on one PC can be applied to thousands.",

You'll use the virtual Windows 10 PC to answer the questions and challenges listed in the project document. For each step, you need to write your answers in the document template, explain how you got the answers, and provide screenshots showing your work. \n\nTo take a screenshot on a Windows system, you can use the **Snipping Tool** or **Snip & Sketch** application (Windows logo key + Shift + S). To take a screenshot on a Macintosh system, press and hold these three keys together: Shift, Command, and 3. You can then paste the image into your report.\n\nIt’s important that you read through the entire document before securing the system and completing your report.\n\n## Advice for students\n - This project is based on instruction throughout the course. It takes you through the NIST CSF, CIS Controls, and Hacker Lifecycle. If you get stuck, go back to that section in the course and review the material. \n - It's important that you write each of the steps you take and use screenshots to show your work. \n - You should keep in mind that there are numerous ways to solve each of the challenges. You should use the method you are most comfortable with rather than getting the \"right\" answers. That's why it's important to **show your work** in your report. \n - Complete all of the sections in the template.  Credit is given for partial answers. \n - There are many security problems with the sample PC. The intent is to give you a challenge based on what you've learned in this course and what you'll see in real life. Have fun exploring. ",
