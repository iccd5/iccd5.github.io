It’s the ability to understand the past and current trends to better understand the future. \nIt’s about being curious, tenacious, and always learning, which means developing your security mindset. \n\nIn March 2008, security pundit [Bruce Schneier blogged about the security mindset](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html). \nSecurity professionals look at the world differently. When they walk into a store, airport, or museum, they naturally look for security guards and cameras. It’s the same on computers where they look for vulnerabilities and error messages to better understand how the technology works. They try to figure out how security can be bypassed to better understand how it can be strengthened.\n\nIn developing your intuition about cybersecurity, consider three mantras. \n* Trust, but verify. \n* Stop.Think.Connect. \n* If you see something, say something. \n\nThroughout this course and your life, continually be building your security mindset and developing your security intuition.",

It’s not only about the sheer number of jobs, but also the types and breadth of work available.\n\nCurrently, we are experiencing a phenomenon known as the *Cybersecurity Skills Gap*. This means the number of open jobs is way beyond the number of cybersecurity people available to fill them. \n\nAccording to a recent survey in [Security Magazine](https://www.securitymagazine.com/articles/92312-of-cybersecurity-leaders-face-skills-shortage), 72% of organizations of all types and sizes are and have been struggling to find quality cybersecurity talent. \n[ISACA](https://www.isaca.org), an international professional association focused on IT audit, governance, risk, and security has a similar survey. Their [State of Cybersecurity 2020 report](https://www.isaca.org/go/state-of-cybersecurity-2020) echoes the challenges of hiring cybersecurity positions. Additionally, two-thirds of respondents say it’s difficult to retain cybersecurity talent.\n\nTo build a career in cybersecurity or technology takes three things:\n* Experience\n* Education\n* Certifications\n\nAlso needed to fill a cybersecurity role are\n* Technical Skills\n* Functional Knowledge\n* Personal abilities \n\nThe *Further Research* area contains links for you to explore including a wiki from Peerlyst with articles on starting or expanding a cybersecurity career. \n\nUse these resources as you are building your cyber career to develop your path and reach your goals. Take a few minutes to visit them and reflect on the information that can help you establish or broaden your cyber career. \n\n\n\n",

These basic ideas are not specific to cybersecurity or IT and are used to structure how we protect our technologies. <br>\nSaltzer and Schroeder’s *Design Principles* published in their paper “The Protection of Information in Computer Systems” in 1975:\n* Economy of mechanism\n* Fail-safe defaults\n* Complete mediation\n* Open design\n* Separation of privilege\n* Least privilege\n* Least common mechanism\n* User-friendly interface\n\n(Source: http://web.mit.edu/Saltzer/www/publications/protection/index.html) \n\n*Economy of Mechanism* means to keep things small and simple. \n- Bigger is not better. It just means there’s more to protect. And complexity is an enemy of security. \n- Complex systems are harder to defend because you need to understand all of the ways to access it and how processes can be broken to allow unauthorized activities.\n\nTo *fail safe* means to anticipate how things can go wrong and to ensure when it does, things are in a safe state. This safe state should be the default, not an exception. To do this, you need to know how something may fail and plan for that failure, which is failing smart.\n\n*Least Privilege* is a concept dealing with Access Control. It means having the minimum privileges or permissions needed to do a job. Nothing more, nothing less. Too much and you could be blamed if there are problems.\n\nFor *choke points* and *defense in depth*\n* Choke Point - only one way in or out\n* Defense in Depth - layers of security\n\nThe CIA of security is *Confidentiality, Integrity,* and *Availability.* ",

Plus, there are so many to remember! \nPassword managers are encrypted vaults that hold your passwords so you don't need to memorize them or write them down. Besides keeping your identity, credentials, and sensitive data safe, a password manager can generate strong, unique passwords to ensure you aren't reusing them across your devices and services. This way, you can use a much longer, complex, and ultimately more secure password. An additional benefit with many password managers is that you can use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) with them. \nCommon password management applications include:\n* [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)\n* [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)\n* [1Password](https://1password.com/)\n* [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/)\n\nSome of these are free and some may require a paid subscription.",
