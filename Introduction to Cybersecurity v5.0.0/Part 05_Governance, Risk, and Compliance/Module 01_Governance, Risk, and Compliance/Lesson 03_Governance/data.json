They are also relied upon to work with employees throughout the organization to ensure they are kept up-to-date on security policies, procedures, and new and emerging security threats.  In this way, governance acts as a bridge between security and the organization. \n\nGovernance professionals, however, also play a vital role in ensuring security controls are operating as expected.  They do this by examining the expected control’s function and designing tests to see if the control does perform as anticipated.  Performing this function consistently can improve an organization’s security posture dramatically by fixing malfunctioning controls before a security event can occur.\n",

Maybe the best opportunity to do this is through an information security steering committee.\n\nMost security best practice handbooks will describe information security steering committees as vital to demonstrating that the organization is invested in security and aligning security with business goals.  It is.  However, many large organizations will have a structured process in place for engaging security with less frequent meetings dedicated to the topic of security.  For companies that do maintain information security steering committees, they act as a platform for the free flow of information and ideas between the business and security.  In this way, security can be informed of any new business objectives or changes to the business, and the business can be kept up-to-date about security initiatives that may require business stakeholder input, like risk management, for example.\n\nThe idea is to keep a free flow of information between the business and security to:\n\n- Align goals\n- Allow the business to provide a certain level of security oversight\n- Work with the business to set and approve policy; and\n- Keep senior leadership informed of new security risks or security challenges\n\nBecause of the level of information sharing that occurs during steering committee meetings, it’s also important to have the right level of participation.  Typically, steering committee members should be in a position to broadly influence and be strategic thinkers.\n",

As a reminder, phishing attempts occur when a bad actor sends email messages attempting to trick users into clicking on a malicious hyperlink or provide personal information like corporate credentials in a web form.  More often than not, these emails are made to appear as if they are coming from well-known organizations, companies our organization works with, or from colleagues. \n\nIt is important to scrutinize every email.  Often phishing emails have spelling mistakes, look slightly different in appearance, or originate come from unexpected domains but sometimes phishing emails look perfectly harmless.  So, you should also scrutinize what the email is asking you to do.  Does it seem out-of-the-ordinary?  Is it something that you wouldn't ordinarily do outside of work (e.g. send money to someone unexpectedly)?  If you receive a phishing email or just aren't sure please contact the information security department at InfoSec@domain.com.\n\nThank you,\n\nCompany Governance Professional\n",

              "text": "Besides acting as a conduit between the organization and security, governance professionals play an important role in measuring the effectiveness of operational security controls.  They measure whether controls are functioning as expected.  Governance does not concern itself initially with how the control came to be --- meaning what risk management decision or compliance requirement the control is intended to address.  Governance does concern itself with the intended function of the control and whether the control meets that intent. \n\nThis is done by examining the control in function and in time.  All controls have an intended function and an intended time with which they operate.  It could be that controls are intended to operate constantly, but it could be that controls are intended to operate at specific intervals.  Take, for instance, a firewall.  The firewall may be performing a number of intended functions, but let’s look at one function.  Perhaps the firewall is meant to block any inbound other than traffic on port 443.  The time element isn’t specified, so we’ll assume it is intended to always operate in the prescribed manner.  The function is that it blocks traffic over port 443.  What if the firewall allowed traffic on ports 443 and 8080?  It might meet our time element but fails the test of function.\nThis is how governance professionals should measure control effectiveness.  Discover the control’s intended function and time and test to ensure that the control operates in that way.\n",

Measuring the effectiveness of controls is a critical part of that equation.  Many organizations have 100’s of security controls, and a single failure or misconfiguration can have a devastating impact.\n\nThis also means, however, that you must make decisions about how best to test controls given limited resources and limited time.  While you should measure controls in function and in time, you must also consider factors that might limit your ability to test as comprehensively as you might like.  Factors like your testing budget, the amount of time you have to test, organizational strategy, and the purpose of your test should all be taken into consideration when designing the appropriate test.\n\nControl tests can be anything that you desire limited only by the considerations we mentioned above and the need to measure for the specific function and time required by the control you plan to assess.  Keep in mind that as you assess security controls, there are certain benefits that should be produced for the organization.  Control measurement should be performed in an effort to:\n\n- Assess existing security tools\n- Improve the organization’s security posture\n- Meet certain compliance obligations\n\nIt’s important that you record each of your control measurement activities, the test performed, when the test was performed, and the outcome.  You should also use control measurement documentation to meet with internal stakeholders to develop plans of action and milestones for remediation, assuming certain controls are not functioning as anticipated.\n",

Is there already a plan in place to bring the 15% of laptops into compliance?  Are the laptop administrators doing any additional monitoring?

              "text": "Policies and procedures make up the backbone of successful security organizations.  Policies set organizational direction and procedures explain exactly how critical tasks are to be executed. \n\nBecause policies are intended to set direction, they have a couple of key characteristics.  First, most policies should be determinative or use determinative language.  They should use words like **shall, shall not, must, most not, or will**.  They do this to very clearly tell readers what is and is not permitted behavior.  Clearly telling readers about expected behaviors is the second characteristic.  Policies are essentially listings of permitted or un-permitted behaviors that serve as security controls themselves.  Just like a firewall is intended to block malicious traffic, policies are intended to be preventive controls telling users that certain actions are or are not allowed.\n\nProcedures, on the other hand, are meant to be tactical documents that tell employees how to perform specific tasks.  Many times, procedures are actually written by non-GRC personnel to support day-to-day activities.  What is important about procedures is that they sometimes support policy.  In fact, nearly every policy statement should have a procedure which details how to accomplish the behavior the policy wishes to enforce.  For instance, if an Information Security Policy requires that user permissions are strictly controlled, there should be a procedure as to how the organization goes about controlling those permissions.\n\nWhile non-GRC personnel often write procedures, GRC staff do write a tremendous amount of policy and write and assess policies and procedures.  When writing or assessing a policy, governance professionals should keep 4 things in mind.  Policies should be:\n\n- Clear in purpose\n- Clear in scope\n- Non-tactical and concise; and\n- Determinative\n\nLike any control, governance professionals should ensure that procedures meet the needs of a control objective in function and in time.\n",
