              "text": "Risk management is undoubtedly a concept you already understand and practice.  In your everyday lives, you’re constantly assessing risk.  You’re thinking about things like whether it's safe to fly today? Is this something I should eat? Or should I trade a stock? Here, we ask whether it's safe to pet a dinosaur?  Regardless of the question, you are likely doing some rough calculation of risk based on prior experience.  In theory, you make a final decision about how to act based on the risk and a perceived benefit.  Let’s talk about the dinosaur, for instance.  Your head probably tells you trying to pet a dinosaur is a bad idea, but wouldn’t it be amazing to tell your friends that you actually pet a dinosaur?  What would you do?  Your decision tells us what your risk tolerance is for petting a dinosaur.\n\nLet’s stick with the dinosaur for just a moment.  If you are assessing risk associated with petting a dinosaur, the action of petting the dinosaur is probably not the risk you’re actually evaluating.  The risk is probably a different question.  Will the dinosaur bite me?  You would probably be assessing the likelihood and the impact of a dinosaur bite.  How likely is it that the dinosaur would bite me?  How devastating would that bite be?  That is how we measure risk.  Risk is the function of (likelihood x impact).\n\nNow, fast forwarding from the Mesozoic era to the 16th century, we start to see an appreciation for the measurement of risk as mathematicians begin to calculate “chance” or probability of occurrence related to dice and card games and by the mid-17th century, Blaise Pascal co-develops the first [Theory of Probability](http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mackey/Teaching/145/probHist.html).  This is noteworthy because probability is seeded in mathematics and probability is the basis for risk management in many industries.  Likelihood roughly equates to probability.  It's also noteworthy because those same mathematical principles don’t necessarily apply to security risk management.  It's this that makes security risk management somewhat controversial.",

What’s the risk?  Let’s assume for a moment that the Likelihood is Medium, and the Impact is High, what would the Risk be?  Is Medium x High = Medium? Or, is Medium x High = High?

              "text": "Now that you understand what risk is, it's important to understand how we express risk.  Expressing risk carefully will help guide you and the organization as to what is actually being assessed.  Take, for instance, a firewall or rather not having a firewall.  It's very easy to make a quantum leap that not having a firewall is a risk.  We know that organizations require firewalls to keep bad traffic out of their networks.  But, not having a firewall is not a risk in and of itself.\n\nRisk statements should be:\n\n- Concise\n- Specific\n- And focused on an action that is or is not being performed\n\nThe Department of Defense created a Risk, Issue and Management guide in 2017 that defined a proper risk statement.  They said:\n\n> “The risk statement contains the potential event or condition, the consequences and, if known, the cause of the event.”\n\nLooking back at our example of not having a firewall, does that meet the Department of Defense (DoD) definition?  No. It doesn’t express any consequence and is not really specific to an event.\n\nBut what if we said, “Firewalls are not configured to block unnecessary inbound traffic which may allow attackers to gain access to internal resources unnoticed.” This is certainly closer to the DoD.  It states a condition (that firewalls are not configured to block unnecessary inbound traffic) and the consequence (that attackers gain access to internal resources).\n\nThe idea being that risk managers should be weighing existing security controls against specific anticipated risks and helping the organization decide on a course of action should the controls not mitigate the risk appropriately.  We’ll discuss additional parts of the risk management process throughout this lesson.\nFor now, let’s turn our attention to Risk Management Frameworks.  The term can be somewhat confusing as it has a couple of meanings.  Risk Management Framework might mean the process that your organization uses to ensure risk management is ingrained in the organization or the concepts the organization follows, or it might mean the actual documentation that you use to perform risk assessment.  We’ll now turn to a couple of examples of the former.\n",

An overview of the framework can be found here:  https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/risk-management/rmf-overview .\n\nGenerally, however, the NIST RMF operates at a higher level than what you might envision as a risk management framework in that it is intended to be a systematic approach to implementing security controls to help control risk as opposed to a framework developed for the specific purpose of assessing risk.\n\nThe Risk Management Framework (RMF) is a set of criteria that dictate how United States government IT systems must be architected, secured, and monitored. Originally developed by the Department of Defense (DoD), the RMF was adopted by the rest of the US federal information systems in 2010.  The RMF is maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).\n\nIt contains a 6-step process for implementing security controls for data and IT systems and dictates best practices and procedures federal agencies must follow when enabling a new system. In addition to the primary document SP 800-37, the RMF uses supplemental documents such as SP 800-30, SP 800-53, SP 800-53A, and SP 800-137.  The supplemental documents can be found alongside the RMF overview.\n\nThe six steps are as follows:\n\n #### Step 1: Categorize Information System\nThe system owner assigns a security rating to an IT system of data based on mission and business objectives.\n\n#### Step 2: Select Security Controls\nSecurity controls for the data or system are selected and approved by leadership.\n\n#### Step 3: Implement Security Controls\nInstall, configure, and, etc. the selected security controls.\n\n#### Step 4: Assess Security Controls \nSecurity tools are assessed and any deficiencies are remediated.\n\n#### Step 5: Authorize Information System \nA risk assessment and risk determination are made about the system and whether it is able to operate given the risk, the system’s categorization, and risk level following the implementation of controls.\n\n#### Step 6: Monitor Security Controls \nSecurity controls are monitored and improved upon continuously.",

              "text": "Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) takes a slightly different approach to risk management.  Instead of the abstract low, medium, and high risk ratings that we’re used to, FAIR proposes a model to measure Value at Risk (VaR).  Value at Risk is intended to measure the value of any data, systems, processes, reputation, relationships, etc. that might be affected as the result of a risk occurrence.  In other words, VaR assigns a dollar value to a risk’s Impact.  The model also requires that an estimate of the rate of occurrence is used to reach the total value at risk over a specific period of time  --- meaning that if you expect a risk to occur 4 times per year than the value of assets would be increase by a factor of 4 to reach the anticipated VaR for the year.\n\nThe benefit to the approach is that it removes some ambiguity and bias that might be present in rating risks and low, medium, high, critical, or etc.  It creates a financial risk target that risk managers can attempt to reduce by applying certain controls.  The challenge is that this approach can require much more effort than traditional approaches, value of data, customer relationships, and other information can be difficult to calculate, and security controls won’t always be applied directly to the risk in questions. \n\nYou can use the link below to access the FAIR-U risk assessment tool.  The tool can be used to perform single FAIR model-based assessments and learn more about how FAIR works:\nhttps://www.fairinstitute.org/fair-u\n",

              "text": "If you navigate to the FAIR website, you can access a free FAIR Risk tool where you can create guided risk assessments based on the FAIR model. Prior to attempting your own assessment, you should spend some time walking through the Example Phishing Database Breach assessment.\n\nThe FAIR-U tool can be found here:  https://www.fairinstitute.org/fair-u\n\nYou can see here that Annual Loss Exposure is calculated based on Loss Event Frequency (likelihood) and Loss Magnitude (impact).  Loss frequency is based on an estimation of how many times an event might occur given the assessor’s knowledge of the business and its vulnerability to a specific risk (given the risk and the organization’s defenses).  Loss Magnitude is based on the expected Primary Loss (direct financial consequences) and Secondary Loss.  Secondary Losses are those that might result from reputation damage, customer loss, or other factors.\n\nIn this example, you can see that the median expected loss based on a successful phishing event is $2.4M and the maximum expected loss is $7.1M.  I think this demonstrates some of the controversy related to putting a price tag on security risk.  Assuming that the risk is calculated correctly at $2.4M-$7.4M on an expected 2 phishing events yearly it would make sense that the organization would be willing to invest a healthy amount to remediate this risk but I’m not sure we understand the right amount to spend.  I’m also not confident we understand where the risk needs to be addressed.  Do we invest heavily in datastore security or do we invest heavily in anti-phishing technology? \n\nThat isn’t to say that FAIR is without value.  In fact, I think its incredibly valuable to create a model capable of demonstrating expected loss but I do think it is very challenging to assess all organizational security risk in this way. \n",

You can read more about it [here](https://www.icas.com/professional-resources/audit-and-assurance/internal-audit/internal-audit-three-lines-of-defence-model-explained).\n\nGenerally, however, the first line of defense is made up of the risk or control owners (typically our business stakeholders).  The second line of defense are our risk managers (GRC professionals) who implement our risk management framework or processes.  The third line of defense is internal audit who provide oversight to control and risk management processes.\n\nThe bridge between our security risk managers (our second line) and our business stakeholders (our first line) are risk assessments.  Risk assessments are what we referred to earlier as the practice documents that organizations may refer to as risk management frameworks --- but they are truly risk assessment documents. \n\nThe way risk assessment documents operate is that they contain a listing of risk statements that risk managers will weigh against the context of a system --- determining the likelihood and the impact of a potential risk (the risk statement) on the system (whatever system you have chosen to assess).  The risk assessments also typically contain statements for any  mitigating controls that might exist and an assessment of the residual risk to the organization.  \n\nTo set up a risk assessment document in a spreadsheet application, you can create the following columns of data:\n1.  Risk Statement - These are the risk statements that you’ll be evaluating against a system.\n\n2.  Likelihood - How likely the risk is to occur.\n\n3.  Impact - How impactful the risk would be if it occurs.\n4.  Mitigating Controls - Any existing controls that reduce risk to the organization.\n5.  Risk - The residual risk after weighing a risk’s likelihood, impact, and existing controls.\n6.  Notes - Any notes that you may wish to make regarding your final assessment of a risk.\n\nYou may additionally add columns for:\n7.  Risk Treatment\n8.  Plans of Action\n\nWe’ll discuss both of these later in this lesson.\n",

This means that the system should dictate what risks an assessor weighs when examining the system and its associated security controls. For instance, you wouldn't use the same risk assessment about the safety of flying in a plane vs. the safety of traveling in a submarine. The risks and controls to mitigate risk are vastly different.\n\nRisk professionals must keep that in mind before performing an assessment. They must understand the system boundary (where the system begins and ends) as well as the system function before beginning an assessment. It's entirely possible that an assessor begins an assessment of a system and realize that the chosen system is either too narrow or broad and need to make adjustments before continuing.\n\nWhat risks should you actually evaluate against a system? This is generally a matter of experience, but you can turn to certain sources like previously conducted risk assessments, certain risk management frameworks, prior audits, or your knowledge of cybersecurity to create risk statements that are appropriate for the system you plan to assess. What's important is to think about each risk in the context of the system, disregard any risk statements that don't apply to your system, and assess against relevant, meaningful risk statements.",

This is the process of making a broad statement about what your organization will do.  Typically, there are 5 options for risk treatment:\n\n- Accept - Accept the risk without taking any further action.\n- Modify - Implement a control that lessens or changes the risk in some way.\n- Avoid - Choose to do something altogether different.\n- Transfer - In most cases cybersecurity risk transference means insuring against the risk occurring through a cybersecurity insurance policy or creating a shared liability model with a vendor.\n- Capitalize – The capitalize option is normally reserved for financial or business risk where there is opportunity to take on additional risk for potential gains.\n\nHow you ultimately decide to treat the risk is a function of the organization’s risk appetite which is based on the company’s risk posture.  Risk posture is how the organization as a whole feels about risk and it is typically based on things like the organization's size, maturity, and business goals.  Risk posture is generally expressed as the organization being risk accepting, risk neutral or risk averse - meaning that the organization is prepared to take on a lot of risk, some risk, or very little risk as a matter or practice.  Again, the organization's posture is all a function of how it intends to operate.  If a company desires high growth, for instance, it may very well be will to take more risk in an attempt to drive that growth.  A organization like this would be risk accepting.\n\nYou’ll need to collaborate closely with business stakeholders to understand risk appetite and reach an appropriate risk treatment option.  In the case of risk acceptance, your organization may very well require a management exception to accept risk --- a process in which a high-level stakeholder acknowledges the acceptance of risk.\n",

They are not intended to be any more complex than a simple spreadsheet that keeps track of your organization’s risk activities. \n\nRisk registers are one of the areas that software can provide lots of value.  I did say earlier that we wouldn't spend a lot of time on GRC software but one of the major benefits of GRC software is that it can help keep a list(risk register) of all outstanding risks rather than keeping a list in a spreadsheet application. It can be somewhat daunting to maintain a list of risks if the organization is highly proactive in its assessments and software can help track the risks from year-to-year and assist in creating new risk assessments.\n",

If you recall, risk treatment only provides the organization with an overall strategic assessment of the risk.  Do you plan to accept it, modify it, remediate it, or transfer it?  If you plan to accept the risk, you can note that in your risk register.  If you plan to do anything else, you must articulate that plan. \n\nIn some organizations these might be called remediation plans or plans of action and milestones (POA&Ms) or Corrective Action Plans.  As a note POA&Ms originated as a US federal term and are more closely related to what we described above as a Risk Register.  In federal terms, the action plans are called Corrective Action Plans and are a part of POA&Ms.  In private organizations the terms POA&M and Corrective Action Plans have been conflated a bit to mean Corrective Action Plan.\n\nRegardless of what they’re called, the plans should state specifically how you plan to deal with the risk, contain anticipated milestones, and anticipated dates.\n",

In this lesson, we discussed some of the historical context associated with risk management and how the mathematical concepts that predate security GRC are not typically used in today’s risk management practice.  We also examined two risk management frameworks in NIST RMF and FAIR and demonstrated the tools that risk managers use to manage risk in today’s organizations.\n\n",
