00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.575
You will occasionally run into edge cases in regards to your update policy.

00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:10.005
There will be times when a server can not be updated due to legacy applications.

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.060
These are older applications that require

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.090
an environment that matches the environment when they were installed.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.750
Updating the system will likely cause the application to crash.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.090
Custom applications occasionally have

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.590
very specific software requirements that preclude updates being installed on the machine.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.730
How do we mitigate the security risks for these types of situations?

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.090
Do not run any other applications on the system,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.610
isolate the server from all traffic not associated with the application,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.340
and monitor the server and alert on any suspicious traffic.
