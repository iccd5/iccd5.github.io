00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's walk through creating a firewall rule together.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.515
Just a quick note.

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:08.700
For this walkthrough, we're going to use a text editor to practice the syntax.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.815
As an analyst in a junior role,

00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:12.780
you'll most likely recommend a rule to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.040
the senior analyst or the network administrator who would then implement the change.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.450
We have a vendor JD software that we want to grant access

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.890
to our internal software repository for a project we're working on together.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.725
Rather than make the repository available to the world,

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:31.230
we'll open up our firewall just for this vendor.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.085
They have an IP address of 123.222.111.2.

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:42.795
Our IP address is 10.10.5.3.

00:00:42.795 --> 00:00:47.620
Our repository is on TCP 8443.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.740
Open up your favorite text editor and follow along.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.555
If you recall from the lesson,

00:00:52.555 --> 00:00:55.390
some organizations name the objects in their firewall for

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.345
both documentation purposes as well as for reuse,

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:01.310
if there are additional rules. We'll do that here.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.030
To name the source IP,

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.945
we type name, the IP address,

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:08.715
and then the name we want to call it.

00:01:08.715 --> 00:01:11.840
In this case, JDS-001.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.885
To name our destination IP,

00:01:13.885 --> 00:01:17.820
we type name, IP address,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.390
and then when the name we want to call it.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.850
In this case, acme-web.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.215
Now that those are in place, let's create the rule.

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:26.780
Remember from our example,

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.870
a basic rule begins with access list.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.539
Since this traffic is coming inbound,

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.300
we'll use our internal interface of acme-ingress-001.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.890
The interface is named when the firewall is initially configured.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.545
Next, we'll use extended permit as we did in our example.

00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:49.530
We're also using the TCP protocol.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.920
For the source we use our named object host jds-001.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.500
For our destination we use the named object for that as well, host acme-web.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.770
The port we're opening is 8443. That's all there is to it.
