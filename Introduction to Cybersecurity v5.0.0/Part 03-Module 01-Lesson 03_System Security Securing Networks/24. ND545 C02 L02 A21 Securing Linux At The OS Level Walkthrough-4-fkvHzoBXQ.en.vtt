00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.295
Let's walk through setting the permissions on a file in our CentOS server.

00:00:04.295 --> 00:00:08.940
Let's create a file called permissionstest.txt.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.925
To do that, type touch, permissionstest.txt, hit "Enter".

00:00:14.925 --> 00:00:17.325
Let's look at the permissions on that file.

00:00:17.325 --> 00:00:23.445
To do that, type ls space minus l. You'll notice that other,

00:00:23.445 --> 00:00:27.135
the third set of permissions has read-only access.

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:30.915
Let's change that to read, write, and execute.

00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:37.305
To do that, type chmod o plus wrx over other,

00:00:37.305 --> 00:00:41.175
and then the file name, permissionstest.txt.

00:00:41.175 --> 00:00:44.400
Now rerun ls space minus l,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.129
and you'll see the updated permissions.
