00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.135
Cybersecurity can seem to be a large and unwieldy field. In a way, it is.

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:09.360
However, security practitioners generally

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.330
specialize in a smaller, more manageable segment.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.265
This allows you to really understand the core principles of your area of responsibility.

00:00:17.265 --> 00:00:22.424
For instance, if an application suddenly becomes intermittently accessible,

00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:25.605
business unit will often ask if there's a firewall.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:29.205
However, you'll know that if there's an intermittent issue,

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:31.065
it's usually not network related,

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:33.735
the bits either flow or they don't.

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:37.195
A firewall either allows, organize.

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:40.400
Once you've lived with solutions you put in place,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.585
you'll develop an inherent intuition how they work.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:46.370
Just like once you've owned the same car for years,

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.130
you recognize the various sounds it makes much better than a friend that borrows the car.

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.565
It takes time, but take good notes, investigate your issues,

00:00:55.565 --> 00:00:58.220
and before you know it, you'll be providing helpful advice

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.830
to your organization right off the top of your head.
