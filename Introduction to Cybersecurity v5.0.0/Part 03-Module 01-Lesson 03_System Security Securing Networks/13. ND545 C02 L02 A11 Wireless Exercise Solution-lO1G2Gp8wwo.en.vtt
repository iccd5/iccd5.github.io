00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.015
Let's take a look at the wireless exercise.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:06.120
You were tasked with researching a solution for

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.495
a wireless implementation and security project for a school system.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:11.580
A school system with five locations is

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.130
requesting help with implementing a wireless solution.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.310
The requirements are, they would like full control over

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.195
the solution and do not want to rely on the Internet to manage the devices.

00:00:21.195 --> 00:00:24.540
The system has a history of students attempting to hack the network,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.365
they would like additional security measures to prevent this type of behavior.

00:00:28.365 --> 00:00:31.080
There are apartments near several of the locations,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.240
and they would like to prevent their neighbors from accessing

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.705
the guest network if possible. Let's see how you did.

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:40.025
The IT department at the schools would like full control.

00:00:40.025 --> 00:00:43.310
We recommend a controller based wireless solution.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.570
This will allow management of the wireless network to be controlled only by

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.690
the school system and will be accessible locally even in the event of an Internet outage.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.960
We recommend WPA2-Enterprise with 802.1X

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.685
authentication method to lower the risk of improper authentication by students.

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:05.975
To diminish the potential use of the guest wireless network by neighbors,

00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:08.240
we recommend a solution that allows for

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.910
signal strength adjustment on the edge access points.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:14.369
There are many vendors that can fulfill these requirements.
