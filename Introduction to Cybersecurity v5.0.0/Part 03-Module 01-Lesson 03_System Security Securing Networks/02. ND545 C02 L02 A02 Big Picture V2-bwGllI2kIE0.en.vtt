00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
A secure computing environment is

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.595
the most important building block in protecting your organization.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:07.560
In this lesson, you'll learn about

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.310
several fundamental components that will make up the foundation of your security.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.740
But why does securing networks matter anyway?

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.445
Secure networks are the bedrock of a secure organization.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.340
Ask any builder, if you get the foundation right,

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.690
you can build anything.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.080
Conversely, if the foundation is poorly constructed,

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.600
no matter how good the building materials are and

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.080
how much care goes into constructing the structure.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.695
It could collapse at any moment.

00:00:31.695 --> 00:00:33.390
Let's look at a few examples.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.500
Here are a few real world examples of poor security foundations.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.720
According to the annual Verizon Data Breach Report for 2017,

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.055
81 percent of all breaches are the result of stolen or weak credentials.

00:00:46.055 --> 00:00:49.355
There are many examples of exposed S3 buckets,

00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:51.850
which is Amazon Web Service Storage.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.535
From personal experience, I've witnessed major outbreaks due to

00:00:55.535 --> 00:01:01.825
out-of-date antivirus and unpatched desktops unpatched SQL instances and several others.

00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:05.120
The moral of the story is to take care of the low hanging fruit and

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.905
the basics before moving on to other levels of security configuration.

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:12.005
Now that the importance of securing networks is clear,

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:15.680
let's move on to how to think like a professional when securing networks,

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.350
there will be additional links available in the classroom.
