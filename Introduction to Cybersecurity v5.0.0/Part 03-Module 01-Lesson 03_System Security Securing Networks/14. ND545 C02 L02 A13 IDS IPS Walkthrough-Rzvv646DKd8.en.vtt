00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.550
Let's create an IDS rule together.

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.010
Just a quick note, for this walk-through,

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.920
we're going to use a text editor to practice the syntax.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.155
As an analyst in a junior role,

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:12.930
you'll most likely recommend a rule to the senior analysts

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.095
or the network administrator who would then implement the change.

00:00:16.095 --> 00:00:19.520
We're creating a rule alerting for HTTPS traffic.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.620
Coming from any source,

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.485
our destination IP is 10.15.11.3.

00:00:26.485 --> 00:00:29.820
That's HTTPS port 443.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.490
We want the administrator to be notified of this traffic,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.065
so we began with alert.

00:00:34.065 --> 00:00:37.035
Next we have TCP for the type of traffic.

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:41.865
We want to be notified if the traffic is coming from any IP, any port.

00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:44.280
The traffic is inbound.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.720
Our destination IP address is 10.15.11.3.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.410
We're using HTTPS, that would be port 443.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.270
Then we have our message.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.345
In this case, we're alerting on HTTPS,

00:00:57.345 --> 00:00:59.370
and we add test, just for the rule.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.460
If you recall, the SID is the identifier,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.410
it has to be one million or higher.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.030
The first 999,999 are reserved for native snort rules.
