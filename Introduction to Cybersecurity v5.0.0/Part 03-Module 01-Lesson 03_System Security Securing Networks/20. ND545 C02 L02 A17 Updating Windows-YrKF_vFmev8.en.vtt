00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.655
To close out this Microsoft Windows section,

00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:05.045
we're going to discuss Windows Updates.

00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:07.560
We'll learn how to determine what version of

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.635
the operating system you're running and the current build number.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.289
We'll view currently installed updates,

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:15.495
the different types of updates,

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:18.080
and lastly, installing new updates.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.585
It's important to know what version of the operating system you are running.

00:00:22.585 --> 00:00:25.010
For this example, we'll use Windows 10,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.610
but the principles apply to all Windows operating systems.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:30.425
To retrieve this information,

00:00:30.425 --> 00:00:32.975
press the Windows button on your keyboard and type,

00:00:32.975 --> 00:00:34.670
"Win Ver", and hit, "Enter."

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.520
You can also type, "Win Ver", from a command line.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.780
As you can see, this machine is running Windows 10.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.045
The Version gets more specific.

00:00:43.045 --> 00:00:45.605
This feature was added in 2015.

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:50.845
The 19 in 1909 indicates this version is from 2019.

00:00:50.845 --> 00:00:53.985
The 09, you might have guessed, is referencing September.

00:00:53.985 --> 00:00:57.950
In recent years, Microsoft have released two versions per year,

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.955
one usually in spring, the other in the fall.

00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:04.730
The OS build consists of two parts separated by a dot.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.000
The left side of the dot is a five digit value,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.190
representing the build number associated with the version released.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.350
On the right side,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:18.185
is a three or four digit code indicating the most recent cumulative update installed.

00:01:18.185 --> 00:01:21.635
For more information, visit the link in the classroom notes.

00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:24.560
There will often be situations where you will want

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.410
to know what updates have been installed on the machine.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.745
For example, when performing a security analysis for audit,

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:34.610
when you are troubleshooting a performance issue,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.740
when performing incident response,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.640
and finally, when installing new applications.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.685
To view existing updates,

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:43.920
open PowerShell and type,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.260
Get-HotFix, and hit, "Enter."

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.740
You'll get an output similar to this.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.735
Here you'll see the description,

00:01:50.735 --> 00:01:54.830
the date installed, and most importantly, the HotFixID.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.715
You can take that ID and look up more information about the update.

00:01:58.715 --> 00:02:02.990
There are many different types of Windows updates, let's go through them.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.735
A critical update, according to Microsoft,

00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:08.840
is a widely released fix for a specific problem

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.350
that addresses a critical non security-related bug.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.080
This could be an emergency patch that resolves

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.200
an issue that was making an application crash.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.240
A definition update is

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.540
a wildly released and frequent software update

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.445
that contains additions to a product's definition database.

00:02:27.445 --> 00:02:33.124
Definition databases are often used to detect objects that have specific attributes,

00:02:33.124 --> 00:02:34.925
such as malicious code,

00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:37.340
phishing websites, or junk mail.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.405
An example would be new malware definitions for Windows Defender.

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:44.120
A driver is the software that interacts

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.300
between your operating system and the device or hardware.

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.420
I will note, some IT professionals prefer to

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.680
download their drivers from the manufacturer of the device.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.350
Feature pack is new product functionality that is first

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.965
distributed outside the context of a product release,

00:03:00.965 --> 00:03:04.565
and that is typically included the next full product release.

00:03:04.565 --> 00:03:07.850
A security update is a wildly released fix for a

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.210
product specific, security-related vulnerability.

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:14.420
Security vulnerabilities are rated by their severity.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.190
The severity rating is indicated in the Microsoft security Bulletin as: critical,

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.830
important, moderate, or low.

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.660
A service pack is a tested cumulative set of all hotfixes,

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.080
security updates, critical updates, and updates.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.590
Additionally, service packs may contain additional fixes

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.400
for problems that are found internally since the release of the product.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.180
A tool is a utility or feature that helps complete a task or set of tasks.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.430
An update, is a widely released fix for a specific problem.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.165
An update addresses a non-critical, non security-related bug.

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:55.350
Now we'll learn strategies for updating Windows.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:01.294
Beginning in 2016, Microsoft views the Windows Operating System as a service,

00:04:01.294 --> 00:04:06.380
meaning that updates must be installed automatically to have the optimal experience.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.050
Therefore, you can no longer pick and choose

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.295
which updates you would like to install without additional software.

00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:15.380
Most organizations with dedicated IT departments

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:18.290
run some centralized Windows patch management.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.905
WSUS, Windows Server Update Services

00:04:21.905 --> 00:04:25.325
is a free utility to help centralize update management,

00:04:25.325 --> 00:04:30.095
automate the installation of updates at a time that most benefits the organization,

00:04:30.095 --> 00:04:34.015
and it helps manage the bandwidth consumption of updates.

00:04:34.015 --> 00:04:38.040
Instead of 400 PCs and servers downloading from the internet,

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:41.130
the updates download to the WSUS server,

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.210
which then pushes them out on the much faster local network.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.705
If your organization has purchased

00:04:46.705 --> 00:04:52.445
SCCM System Center Configuration Manager as a component of configuration manager,

00:04:52.445 --> 00:04:55.505
it can be used for Windows Updates,

00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:58.115
installation of new applications,

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:03.270
OS upgrades, Antivirus scans, and much more.
