00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.405
You are tasked with creating several users, groups,

00:00:03.405 --> 00:00:07.280
and directories and your CentOS lab server. Let's see how you did.

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.430
In this exercise, you learned how to use several new Linux commands.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.220
You create a groups using groupadd.

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.010
You created users using adduser.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.920
You added those users to their respective groups with

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.625
usermode and you create a directories with mkdir.

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:27.765
Finally, you change the owner of the directories with chown.

00:00:27.765 --> 00:00:32.200
Great job. Your results should look something like this.
