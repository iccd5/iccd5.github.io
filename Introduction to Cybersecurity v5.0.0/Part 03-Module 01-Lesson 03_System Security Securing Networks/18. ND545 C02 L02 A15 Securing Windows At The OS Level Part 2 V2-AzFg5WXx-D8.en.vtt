00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
Windows services are small programs that run in the background of the operating system.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.150
Thankfully, services are much more streamlined in modern versions of Windows.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.150
We'll talk about the types of Windows services,

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.999
how to start/stop Windows services,

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.445
change the status, and finally,

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:19.965
which services can be safely disabled?

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:24.465
There are three primary types of Windows services accounts.

00:00:24.465 --> 00:00:28.785
Local services privileges are limited to the local computer.

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:31.920
Use the local service user account if

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.660
the worker process does not require access outside of the server in which it is running.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.950
The built-in network service user account has

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.555
fewer access privileges on the system than the local system user account.

00:00:44.555 --> 00:00:47.540
But the network service user account is still able to

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.240
interact throughout the network with the credentials of the computer account.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.440
The local system account is

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.790
a predefined local account used by the service control manager.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.190
It has extensive privileges on

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.375
the local computer and acts as the computer on the network.

00:01:05.375 --> 00:01:08.539
There are numerous ways to access Windows services.

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:11.675
Try holding down the "Windows" key and hitting the "R".

00:01:11.675 --> 00:01:16.860
When the run dialog box pops out, type services.msc.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.705
There are four startup types for Windows services.

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:26.885
Automatic, services will start at boot time.

00:01:26.885 --> 00:01:29.090
Automatic with a delayed start,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.625
services will start just after boot time.

00:01:31.625 --> 00:01:33.455
As you look through your services,

00:01:33.455 --> 00:01:35.320
you can see, there are quite a few of them.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.180
There is a rush when a machine boots as they all compete for system resources.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.520
By setting a service to automatic with a delayed start,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.455
this spreads the system load out a bit and can result in a quicker overall startup.

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:52.030
Manual is starting a service manually when needed,

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.935
this can be a computer user or an application.

00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:59.140
Disabled stops a service from starting, even if needed.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.024
From a security perspective,

00:02:01.024 --> 00:02:02.870
you'll want to perform the analysis

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.140
each server and to disable any services that are not needed.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.545
This will shrink the attack service for that particular machine.

00:02:09.545 --> 00:02:13.550
In order to determine which services you can safely disable,

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:14.960
you'll need to work closely with

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.595
the systems administration team to baseline what the server's purpose is.

00:02:19.595 --> 00:02:24.260
This will allow you to research and provide a list of recommended services.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.300
You're probably wondering what are

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.055
some examples of services you can disable on your Windows server.

00:02:30.055 --> 00:02:33.185
If you're not using Bluetooth, it can be disabled.

00:02:33.185 --> 00:02:37.160
Hopefully, known as using a server for Xbox applications,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.160
ActiveX installer can be safely disabled.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.100
There will likely be several services you can disable.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.830
Just take your time and work closely with the sysadmin team.
