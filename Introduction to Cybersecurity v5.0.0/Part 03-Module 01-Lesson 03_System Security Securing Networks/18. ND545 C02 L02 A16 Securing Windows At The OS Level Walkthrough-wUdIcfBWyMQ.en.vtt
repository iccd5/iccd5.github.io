00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
Let's take a look at setting Windows directory permissions together.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.815
We'll check the existing folder permissions and we'll add the maintenance group.

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:11.030
Let's set the proper permissions for the maintenance department.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.500
First, we right-click the folder and go to Properties.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.350
Then we select the Security tab,

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.065
then we select "Edit."

00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:24.210
As we learned in the lesson,

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.640
the administrators group has full control.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.200
However, we see that the user's group has Read &amp; execute,

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.775
and List folder contents.

00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:35.950
Let's go ahead and Remove their access.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.670
Now select "Add," type maintenance,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.185
click "Check Names" and then "OK".

00:00:49.185 --> 00:00:53.520
Let's give the group Full control and then

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.660
click "Apply" and "OK. " That's all there is to it.
