00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
In this section, we'll learn about firewalls.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.070
By the end of this section,

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.245
we will understand what a firewall does,

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:10.350
differentiate between the primary types of firewalls,

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.035
breakdown the anatomy of a firewall rule,

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:14.835
and then we'll craft our own rule.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:18.675
Where does firewall fit in our three component model of security?

00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:23.400
It has all three, prevention, detection, and response.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.410
Just a high-level refresher here,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.150
we will get into specifics in a bit.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.170
A firewall is a network device that monitors incoming and outgoing traffic.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.640
It allows or denies traffic based on

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.520
a defined set of rules configured by the administrator.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.580
But before we discuss further what a firewall does,

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.400
let's talk about what a firewall does not do.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.170
At it's most basic level,

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:50.210
a firewall does not know if traffic is good or traffic is bad.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.435
It simply allows the traffic you tell it to allow,

00:00:53.435 --> 00:00:55.750
it denies the traffic you tell it to deny.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.730
No more, no less.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.665
A firewall is one of the most basic components

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:03.785
of an organization's security and risk infrastructure.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:07.120
Your business insurance may require a firewall,

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.800
and most certainly if your organization is subject

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.560
to compliance regulation is required to have one.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.525
What if you run a small business?

00:01:14.525 --> 00:01:18.200
Why would a hacker want access to your specific network?

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.540
A significant portion of internet traffic consists of automated bots,

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.425
worms, and general malware.

00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:27.710
Even if a hacker isn't after your company specifically,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.855
these automated threats have created

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.410
a level playing field where we're all susceptible to attack.

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.850
Relying only on the firewalls on your individual machines will allow threats

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.485
to infiltrate the network and either spend time attempting different vulnerabilities,

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:47.470
or using your network as a launching point for attacks on other organizations.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.405
This can cause performance issues with your network,

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:52.715
email flow, and general computing.

00:01:52.715 --> 00:01:56.110
To put it simply, you need a well-maintained firewall.

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.720
There are many different types and subtypes of firewalls out there.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.450
We're going to focus on the three primary types.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.510
The network or hardware-based firewall,

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.985
the host based firewall,

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:10.340
and the application firewall.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.409
When you read the word firewall,

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.650
you are most likely thinking of the hardware-based firewall.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.250
It is a device that resides on the edge of your network and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.210
separates your internal or local network from the outside world.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.030
A firewall is a computing device with

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.390
components specifically designed for its intended purpose.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.210
It has a CPU, RAM,

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.375
long-term storage for operating system and rules

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:38.675
usually in the form of flash storage or MB RAM,

00:02:38.675 --> 00:02:40.715
which is non-volatile RAM.

00:02:40.715 --> 00:02:45.740
A firewall will have at least two network interfaces inside and outside.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.220
It may have additional physical interfaces as well as logical sub interfaces.

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:56.135
A host based firewall typically runs within an operating system on a computer.

00:02:56.135 --> 00:03:00.064
Think Windows firewall, Mac OS firewall,

00:03:00.064 --> 00:03:02.905
and IP tables on your Linux distro.

00:03:02.905 --> 00:03:05.885
Here, we have an important difference in scope.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:11.890
A host based firewall typically protects only the computer and services it is running on.

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:15.590
It does not generally protect any other machines.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.140
It can often be used in conjunction with

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.715
the network firewall as an additional layer of security.

00:03:21.715 --> 00:03:26.655
An application-based firewall operates at layer seven of the OSI model.

00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:29.510
It is generally concerned with the protection of

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.960
applications as opposed to general network security.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.539
Think SQL injection attacks,

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:38.975
cross-site scripting attacks, and DDOS attacks.

00:03:38.975 --> 00:03:44.010
Application firewalls are often used in conjunction network firewalls.
