00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's, walkthrough a wireless implementation project.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.895
Here are the initial requirements.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:11.025
The organization has three geographic locations and an aggressive growth plan.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:15.465
They are requesting a solution with high throughput and signal strength.

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.780
They do not want a complicated configuration.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.130
Based on what we've learned in our research,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.130
here are the following recommendations.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.320
Due to the multiple geographic locations and the desire for simplicity and configuration,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.030
we recommend a Cloud-based controller rather than an on-premises controller.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.640
A mesh network layout where all the access points communicate with their neighbors,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.275
will allow for the throughput and signal strength the customer requested.

00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:44.480
Many vendors offer access points that will auto

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.485
configure based on a neighboring access points configuration.

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:52.900
This simplifies configuration and makes scaling the network easier.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:58.080
As a precaution, we recommend an N plus 1 quantity of access points,

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.745
where N equals a given number of access points in a specific area,

00:01:01.745 --> 00:01:03.650
such as a segment of a floor.

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.980
This will allow additional coverage and will provide

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.510
consistent connectivity should a single access point fail.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:14.729
There are many vendors that offer solutions that will meet these requirements.
