00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.590
For this example, we'll use a basic Cisco firewall rule.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.690
While there are many other methods,

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.495
they will all have a similarity in the syntax.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:14.280
A Cisco firewall rule will have the interface being used,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.895
whether the traffic is being allowed or denied,

00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:20.055
what protocols are used,

00:00:20.055 --> 00:00:22.470
what objects are involved,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.915
and finally, the service or port.

00:00:24.915 --> 00:00:27.525
This is not a comprehensive list,

00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.720
we're looking at a basic rule.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.510
If we are Acme incorporated and we have

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.570
a vendor that needs to connect with our database server,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.135
here is what a sample rule might look like.

00:00:38.135 --> 00:00:40.670
Keep in mind, this is a basic rule.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.135
There are other methods of access control.

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:45.620
The rule begins with access list,

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.440
which is simply a rule that controls traffic.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.205
Next up is the name of the interface being used.

00:00:52.205 --> 00:00:54.695
If you recall from just a few moments ago,

00:00:54.695 --> 00:01:00.205
a firewall will have at minimum two interfaces, outside and inside.

00:01:00.205 --> 00:01:03.319
This example is showing the traffic will be traversing

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:07.655
our internal interface to ultimately reach our database server.

00:01:07.655 --> 00:01:12.730
Here, we are using an extended permit as opposed to a standard permit.

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:18.530
An extended permit gives additional flexibility in matching the traffic more granularly.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.590
For this rule, we're identifying that TCP is the protocol being used.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.075
UDP is another common option.

00:01:26.075 --> 00:01:29.040
Source is listed before destination.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.200
In this rule, we're identifying

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.795
the IP address that will be allowed to access our database server.

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:37.790
Often organizations will name the IP address for

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.195
additional information as well as the ability to reuse it later.

00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:43.120
Here, we'll just use the IP.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.210
The destination is the IP address of our database server.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.655
Eq means equal to,

00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:54.170
and in this request we're processing the port as 9081.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.930
Management often get impatient with having to wait on security to allow specific traffic.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.225
It isn't uncommon to be asked,

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:04.385
why do we need this and other rules?

00:02:04.385 --> 00:02:07.220
Why can't we make our servers public-facing?

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.750
By securing our database server and other resources behind the firewall,

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.475
we ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed.

00:02:15.475 --> 00:02:19.970
This protects us from malicious traffic as well as our intellectual property.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.010
As you learned in a previous lesson,

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.745
the principle of least privilege should always be practiced.

00:02:25.745 --> 00:02:28.960
The minimum level of access is always preferred.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.655
It does not apply only to login accounts.

00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:33.830
A quick note before we move on,

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.985
most firewalls process their rules from top to bottom.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:41.390
This is important to note because a firewall will not

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.070
process any further rules once a condition is met.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.730
Your rules should be more specific at the top and more general near the bottom.
