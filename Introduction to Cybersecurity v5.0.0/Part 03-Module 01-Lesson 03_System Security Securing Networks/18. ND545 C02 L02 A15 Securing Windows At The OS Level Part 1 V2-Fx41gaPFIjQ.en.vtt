00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
We're now turning our attention to operating systems.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:04.680
As a security professional,

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.125
you may or may not be the one securing individual machines,

00:00:08.125 --> 00:00:09.660
but you will certainly engage with

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.785
the systems administration team on what should and should not be running.

00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:19.035
In this section, we'll evaluate documentation to determine proper security settings,

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:21.165
learn about Windows Services,

00:00:21.165 --> 00:00:23.190
learn about file permissions,

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.155
and close it out with Windows Updates.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:29.490
This section will include prevention for Mac 3 component model of security.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.140
While every organization's overall technology configurations are unique,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.870
there are so many possible configurations and server

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.965
operating systems to make one size fits all recommendations impossible,

00:00:40.965 --> 00:00:43.575
that's why we rely on best practices.

00:00:43.575 --> 00:00:49.025
This allows a baseline of security to accompany the business needs of the organization.

00:00:49.025 --> 00:00:51.080
As you learned in the previous lesson,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.175
NIST has extensive documentation for securing your environment.

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:59.225
If your organization is subject to any regulatory compliance,

00:00:59.225 --> 00:01:01.850
you will need to familiarize yourself with requirements.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.830
Most compliance requirements are concerned with access, updates, and logging.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.155
Microsoft provides recommendations on all of their products.

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:13.570
You can download their server security guide,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.830
it offers advice on updates,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:18.715
privileges, and several other system settings.

00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:22.460
If your organization is subject to regulatory compliance,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.050
such as PCI or HIPAA,

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.690
there's documentation available that provides

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.390
security configuration requirements that must be met.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.910
We will begin with Windows file permissions.

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.600
Permissions are fundamental to securing your computing environment.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.800
Not only do they offer protection from an outside attacker perspective,

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.935
but also regarding compliance and data integrity.

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:45.710
Full control is exactly what it says.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.470
It permits reading, writing,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.070
changing, and deleting of files and subfolders.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.000
Modify permits reading and writing of files and subfolders,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.845
and allows deletion of the folder.

00:01:57.845 --> 00:02:01.610
Read and execute permits the viewing of files and sub-folders,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.940
as well as the executing files.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.400
List folder contents permits viewing and listing of

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.865
files and subfolders as well as the executing files.

00:02:10.865 --> 00:02:14.660
Write permits the adding of files and subfolders.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.390
Read permits the viewing of files.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.710
Here is a table to review all of the permissions,

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:22.840
let's take a look at an example.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.400
Here's a departmental directory for marketing.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.030
The first object in the permissions is the administrative group.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.740
It is not uncommon.

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.395
In fact, it's generally standard procedure,

00:02:33.395 --> 00:02:37.580
but the administrator group to have full access to the entire server.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.445
This allows the machine to be properly maintained.

00:02:40.445 --> 00:02:43.595
Next on the list is the marketing group themselves.

00:02:43.595 --> 00:02:45.830
You'll notice they have permission to read,

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.460
write, and execute anything in the folder.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.850
Lastly, you'll see the IT group.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.040
While it is possible to nest the IT group inside the administrators group,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.780
there isn't any functional difference when it

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.990
comes to the permissions we're looking at today.

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.820
The IT group generally needs full access

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:04.675
to the entire server environment to perform new duties.

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:08.435
If you recall from our discussion of the principle of least privilege,

00:03:08.435 --> 00:03:11.540
the accounts in the IT group may be used only for

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.310
administrative purposes and not for normal computer usage.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.530
To review, the administrator and IT group have

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.980
similar rights and in some cases would be nested into one.

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.030
Marketing group have the required access to create,

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.550
read, write, and execute files.
