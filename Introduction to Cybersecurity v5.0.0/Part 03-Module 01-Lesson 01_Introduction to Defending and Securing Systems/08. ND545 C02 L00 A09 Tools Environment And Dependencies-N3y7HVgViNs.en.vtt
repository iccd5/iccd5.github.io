00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
Here's what you'll need for this course.

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:05.700
You will access this on any computer that can successfully render

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.660
the videos and connect to remote desktop, and potentially SSH.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.275
Tablets, are not recommended and may affect your experience.

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:17.460
There are a total of five virtual machines that are hosted in Azure.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:24.290
Two of them, Windows Server 2016 and CentOS 7.X are for the labs and three of them,

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.505
a Windows 10 machine,

00:00:25.505 --> 00:00:30.000
server 2016 and CentOS 7.X are for the course project.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.490
While it is included in the instructions,

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.895
I want to remind you that when you are not using the Azure VMs,

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:39.850
you need to power them off to save usage credits and money.
