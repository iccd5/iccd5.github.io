00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.370
Let's take a quick high-level look at

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.310
the history of computer systems and the need to defend them.

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.680
World War II generated probably

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.700
the largest explosion of technical innovation in history to that point.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.815
Not just in the form of weapons,

00:00:13.815 --> 00:00:17.460
but also in code machines and computers to crack those codes.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.785
Fast-forward to the 1960s,

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:24.510
and many universities have computers and have begun offering time on them where students,

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.105
and occasionally the public can utilize the services.

00:00:27.105 --> 00:00:31.065
This is where Bill Gates and Paul Allen were first introduced to computers.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.955
Also in the 1960s,

00:00:32.955 --> 00:00:36.225
the US government began working on networking these universities,

00:00:36.225 --> 00:00:39.240
creating the first Internet known as ARPANET.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.455
The 1980's introduced the first roll-out of commercial Internet.

00:00:43.455 --> 00:00:46.115
This would begin modern networking as we know it,

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:48.590
as well as the new field of information security,

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.390
also known as cybersecurity.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.520
The 1990s brought us several advancements,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.845
the rise of computers at home with Microsoft Windows 95 and 98,

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:00.550
the rollout of high-speed at that time,

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.785
Internet to businesses and dial up to homes.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:08.135
Cell phones became more commonplace and the first commercial firewall was sold.

00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:13.039
The first decade of the 2000s brought both wireless and high-speed Internet to homes,

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:14.780
and smartphones to our pockets.

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.145
It was during this decade,

00:01:16.145 --> 00:01:21.210
e-mail phishing exploded in prevalence and hacking became an industry in itself.
