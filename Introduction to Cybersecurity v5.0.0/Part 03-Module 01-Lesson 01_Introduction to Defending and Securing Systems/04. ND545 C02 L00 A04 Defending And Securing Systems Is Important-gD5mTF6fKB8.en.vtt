00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Almost everything you interact with or rely on daily has an information component.

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.440
Usually that information is on a computer.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.050
Factor in, that that computer is likely on

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.514
the Internet and suddenly, cybersecurity is necessary.

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:17.445
For instance, utility systems are computer operated.

00:00:17.445 --> 00:00:20.310
While thankfully, most are not Internet connected,

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.860
they remain a target for malicious actors.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.830
The financial industry is under constant attack.

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.620
Hackers and nation-state actors are committed to

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.100
breaching banking systems and stealing money and information.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.690
One of the least publicize,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.665
but most important areas of security is protecting intellectual property.

00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:40.520
For medical research, industrial secrets,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.655
to weapons of war, this information is highly sought after.

00:00:43.655 --> 00:00:46.680
Imagine someone hacking your grandfather's pacemaker.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.960
Unfortunately, it is a real threat.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.930
Cybersecurity can help protect medical devices from being compromised.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.300
Many people are concerned with their personal information being stolen,

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.100
this is a very real threat.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.775
Millions fall victim to some form of identity theft every year.

00:01:01.775 --> 00:01:07.695
Common results are establishing new credit or using existing credit fraudulently.

00:01:07.695 --> 00:01:12.785
In every spring, hackers file income tax refunds using stolen Social Security numbers.

00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:14.345
These are just a few reasons why

00:01:14.345 --> 00:01:18.360
cybersecurity and the skills learned in this course are important.
