00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.845
In the lessons that follow,

00:00:01.845 --> 00:00:04.755
you will learn that security is a layered proposition,

00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:06.300
the more layers you have,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.505
the more they support one another and act

00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:11.340
as building blocks to protect your organization.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.915
In addition to layers,

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:15.240
we will frame all of the subsequent skills you'll

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.720
learn in the form of a three component model of security.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.240
The first component is prevention.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.430
When most people think of cybersecurity,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.840
they're thinking of this component,

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.660
keep the bad guys out and the good stuff in.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.030
The second component is detection.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.575
Should the adversary get past our preventative defenses, we want to know.

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:36.780
Response is the final component.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.410
You must have an incident response plan for those events that are detected.
