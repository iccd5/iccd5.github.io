00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
Now let's turn to the course project.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.495
You will use a different set of virtual machines to complete these exercises.

00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:08.370
However, the setup will be the same.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.500
The project is scenario-based.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.260
You are the new security analyst at DFI,

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.780
and we're going to go through your first two weeks on the job.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.185
You will connect to the environment and perform a security audit.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.515
You will recommend new firewall and IDS rules.

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:24.990
From there, you will recommend VPN encryption

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.870
and demonstrate the use of at rest encryption.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.690
Finally, you'll recommend areas to automate and

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.900
summarize all of this and report to management. You got this.
