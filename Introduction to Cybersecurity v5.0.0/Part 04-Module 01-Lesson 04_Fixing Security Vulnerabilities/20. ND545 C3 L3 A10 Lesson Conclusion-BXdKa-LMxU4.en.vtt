00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.390
Remediation planning helps security professionals

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.025
understand and prioritize which vulnerabilities matter most.

00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:11.445
At this point, you should be able to conduct

00:00:11.445 --> 00:00:17.175
vulnerability research using industry resources like MITRE's CVE framework.

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.995
You should be able to validate scan results,

00:00:19.995 --> 00:00:23.850
also prioritize security gaps that have been discovered,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.820
and recommend remediation strategies.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.295
So kudos on making it this far,

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:32.174
you're now aware of some of the factors to be considered

00:00:32.174 --> 00:00:36.700
as you work to prioritize and remediate your findings.
