00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
In this exercise, you're tasked with determining,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.780
what's the most critical vulnerability in this list?

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:08.445
What harm could it cause,

00:00:08.445 --> 00:00:10.260
and how can it be fixed?

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:17.820
CVE-2020-0609 is one of the critical severity items in the list.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.510
Typically, critical issues are just that critical and needs to be fixed right away.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.945
In this case, it's a remote execution issue.

00:00:27.945 --> 00:00:31.425
One of the worst because it means if exploited,

00:00:31.425 --> 00:00:35.985
people can control or manipulate your system from virtually anywhere.

00:00:35.985 --> 00:00:41.195
So when an unauthenticated attacker connects to

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:47.180
the target system using RDP and sends specially crafted requests to exploit this,

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.300
they could execute arbitrary code on

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.795
the target system and so an attacker could then install programs,

00:00:54.795 --> 00:01:00.985
they can view, change or delete data or create new accounts with full user rights.

00:01:00.985 --> 00:01:03.440
To exploit this vulnerability,

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.440
an attacker would need to send a specially crafted request to the target system's,

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.415
RD Gateway via RDP.

00:01:12.415 --> 00:01:14.585
In terms of the solution,

00:01:14.585 --> 00:01:18.980
there's a patch update available that addresses this issue and so

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.710
that corrects how RD Gateway handles connection requests.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.130
So that patch just needs to be applied and this vulnerability will be fixed.
