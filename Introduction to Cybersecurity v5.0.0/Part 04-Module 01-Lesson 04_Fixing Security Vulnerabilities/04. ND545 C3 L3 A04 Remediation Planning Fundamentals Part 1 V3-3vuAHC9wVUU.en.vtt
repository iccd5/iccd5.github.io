00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
You should already know from the previous lesson that

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.750
the overall vulnerability management process includes eight steps.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.710
The first three are what contribute to finding gaps.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.980
After that process, you should have one of

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.840
several reports from the vulnerability scanner or from your penetration test.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.560
With that list, the last five steps in the process contribute to fixing the issues.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.300
Here are the steps.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.210
First, you validate findings.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:37.280
This is where you confirm that vulnerabilities are valid and remove any false positives.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.125
The next step is to prioritize.

00:00:40.125 --> 00:00:43.745
You rank the vulnerabilities based on risk and

00:00:43.745 --> 00:00:48.505
other factors that help signify what should be addressed first.

00:00:48.505 --> 00:00:50.280
Then remediate.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.610
You work with appropriate resources to fix the issues.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.370
After that, you retest.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.110
Rescan or retest to confirm that the vulnerability has been

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.385
fixed and that other gaps were not exposed in the process.

00:01:04.385 --> 00:01:06.735
Finally, close.

00:01:06.735 --> 00:01:10.195
This is where you document the closure of the vulnerability.

00:01:10.195 --> 00:01:15.395
One of the common terms when discussing vulnerabilities is the severity level.

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:18.155
Just as on a hot summer day,

00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:20.614
if it's 80 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:01:20.614 --> 00:01:23.635
you might say, "It's hot outside."

00:01:23.635 --> 00:01:26.445
If it's 90 degrees,

00:01:26.445 --> 00:01:29.895
you might say, "It's very hot outside."

00:01:29.895 --> 00:01:32.460
If it's 100 degrees,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.740
you might say, "It is scorching."

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.290
So you apply different terms based on how hot it is.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.820
The same applies to security vulnerabilities.

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.920
Severity ratings are applied based on how significant the vulnerability is.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.565
Common severity levels include critical,

00:01:52.565 --> 00:01:57.330
high, medium, and low.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.110
These become the foundation for understanding

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.100
your vulnerabilities and prioritizing your remediation efforts.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.590
Because there are so many vulnerabilities spread across various systems,

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.555
there needed to be a common scoring convention and way to measure severity.

00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:19.295
Otherwise, through different perspectives,

00:02:19.295 --> 00:02:22.355
the same vulnerability could be defined as critical

00:02:22.355 --> 00:02:26.260
in one place while it's medium in another.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.880
CVSS was a framework created to address this.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.875
The common vulnerability scoring system, also called CVSS,

00:02:35.875 --> 00:02:39.560
provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.674
a vulnerability and produced a numerical score that reflects its severity.

00:02:44.674 --> 00:02:47.300
That score can be translated into

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.080
a qualitative representations such as low, medium, high,

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.290
or critical to help companies properly assess and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.770
prioritize their vulnerability management process.

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.575
In a nutshell, it's a system for measuring

00:03:00.575 --> 00:03:03.980
the relative severity of different vulnerabilities.

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.165
Now the score is calculated based on, first, exploitability.

00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:13.820
This is considering elements like the attack vector,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.995
whether privileged credentials are required, and more.

00:03:17.995 --> 00:03:20.355
The next one is impact.

00:03:20.355 --> 00:03:23.510
This is taking into consideration how does it impact

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.390
the CIA triad or the confidentiality,

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.200
integrity, and availability of the system.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.470
Lastly, temporal and environmental factors.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.405
For example, what remediation options are available?

00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:42.770
Now the resulting number can be translated again into critical, high,

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.210
medium, or low issues and that becomes the basis of your remediation planning.
