00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.025
To complete this activity,

00:00:02.025 --> 00:00:05.805
you'd need to understand that each of the vulnerabilities listed,

00:00:05.805 --> 00:00:09.420
and how the context provided might impact them.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.625
For example, in the context,

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.895
you can see that RDP is,

00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:20.550
or at least should be disabled across the entire company through group policy,

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.990
which is a centralized way to manage security settings.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:33.255
Now, vulnerability, CVE-2020-0609 is associated with RDP,

00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:38.205
though it's been detected based on the context regarding the company.

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:43.675
This could be a false positive until before officially addressing it as such.

00:00:43.675 --> 00:00:50.390
It's important to verify either yourself or with the technical team to determine if it is

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.690
truly a false positive or figure out why

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.685
it's alerting when the protocol isn't enabled within the company.

00:00:57.685 --> 00:01:00.660
You may find it's an oversight in the tool,

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.810
or you may indeed find that RDP is not disabled, like you thought.
