00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
The only thing worse than finding security gaps in

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:06.885
your company is finding them and knowing about them,

00:00:06.885 --> 00:00:09.465
but doing nothing to fix it.

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:12.270
This can lead to a host of issues,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.705
from non-compliance with certain regulations to

00:00:15.705 --> 00:00:19.875
legal liabilities for being negligent when it comes to security.

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.740
Let's take Equifax, for example.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.260
The breach is said to have impacted about half of the entire United States population.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.370
So hundreds of millions of data records were exposed and

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.080
the breach cost the company millions of dollars in response and damages.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.500
Now the breach happened in 2017.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.180
One of the most concerning parts here is that the vulnerability

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.755
that the attackers exploited was released back in 2012.

00:00:48.755 --> 00:00:51.895
That's five years before the breach.

00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:55.175
So even though the vulnerability was exposed,

00:00:55.175 --> 00:00:56.945
it was not fixed.

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:00.710
Now what this means is that it's possible this could have been

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.440
mitigated or potentially avoided with the right remediation effort.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.450
Remediation is a necessary step after finding issues to avoid scenarios like this.
