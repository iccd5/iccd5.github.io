00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Once you've validated everything and know

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.390
that for the most part you're focusing on true positives,

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.840
remediation of issues can be ranked based on

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.100
several factors depending on what makes the most sense for the company.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.105
Some of those factors include: the severity level,

00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:21.450
the budget available to fix the issue,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.635
the time and effort it takes to remediate the issue,

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:29.115
cost-benefit analysis on whether the potential loss

00:00:29.115 --> 00:00:33.750
the vulnerability can cause is greater than the cost it would take to fix it,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.500
and last but not least, regulatory requirements.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.970
Sometimes not fixing an issue no matter what the severity can land you in legal trouble.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.165
So these are the common factors to keep in mind,

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:49.870
but companies may also choose to add others.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.380
When prioritizing vulnerabilities,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.990
a general rule of thumb is that the higher the severity,

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:59.330
the sooner you'll want to close the gap.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:05.780
But also anytime there's a regulatory compliance issue such as a law that mandates a fix,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.240
you may want to prioritize that too.

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.950
However, this all boils down to cost-benefit analysis.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.765
For example, if a fine for non-compliance to the company is, let's say,

00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:21.575
$1,000 and the fix is $100,000,

00:01:21.575 --> 00:01:24.595
but you have other mitigating controls in place already,

00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:30.305
you might decide to accept the risk of that fine for now and not fix the issue.

00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:33.320
On the contrary, if a vulnerability costs,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.225
let's say, $10,000 to fix,

00:01:35.225 --> 00:01:38.335
but the potential impact of the gap is a million dollars,

00:01:38.335 --> 00:01:41.930
you might want to consider committing to full remediation.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.990
Additional manual testing can also be done during

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.229
this phase to ensure you are focusing on true positives.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.960
Just remember, it's an ongoing process.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.760
Prioritizing the findings brings you one step closer to remediation.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.810
During this process, it's good to have a standard framework or service-level agreements,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.255
also termed SLAs, for executing on remediation.

00:02:07.255 --> 00:02:13.310
This can help you consistently determine how quickly you should fix certain issues.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.495
You already know, you need to take into consideration different factors,

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.350
including severity when you prioritize.

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:23.915
Those factors can also influence your SLAs.

00:02:23.915 --> 00:02:28.550
Let's say we are focusing on using severity to drive your SLAs.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.220
You may come up with a standard like this.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.940
You might say low severity issues are optional to fix,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.150
medium severities need to be fixed within 90 days,

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.295
high severity within 60 days,

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:43.205
and critical severity within 30 days.

00:02:43.205 --> 00:02:45.320
But you might add that, hey,

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.220
if something applies to a regulatory issue or environment,

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.960
even if it's not critical,

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.575
it must be fixed within 30 days.

00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.195
There are many different combinations to this,

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:58.355
and it depends on the company,

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:01.160
but you must have something to guide this process.

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.585
I remember when I manage vulnerability remediation earlier in my career,

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.805
the minute I created a standard like this,

00:03:07.805 --> 00:03:11.705
I went from barely being able to keep up with fixes each month

00:03:11.705 --> 00:03:16.100
to accomplishing full remediation of all issues on a monthly basis.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:21.720
We even had a record breaking streak and so this makes a huge difference.
