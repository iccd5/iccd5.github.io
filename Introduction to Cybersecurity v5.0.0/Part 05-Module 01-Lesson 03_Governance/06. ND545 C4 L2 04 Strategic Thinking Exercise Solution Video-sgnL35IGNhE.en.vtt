00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
The key to answering this exercise is really recognizing that a

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.110
disconnect exist between business strategy and

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.335
operations strategy in the security organization.

00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:15.195
The business wants to move more rapidly and they want to innovate quickly.

00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:17.190
They also want to transition all of

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.460
their architecture to the Cloud in the next 18 months.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.360
They want to be more agile and they want to improve business resiliency.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.620
But for the security organization,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.765
they're heavily invested in their current architecture.

00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:34.465
They're invested in things like network security, all on-premise solutions.

00:00:34.465 --> 00:00:36.425
As it relates to cloud security,

00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:38.345
they're not as heavily invested there.

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:40.460
So you need to realize that

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.050
the security budget is going to change dramatically over the next couple of years.
