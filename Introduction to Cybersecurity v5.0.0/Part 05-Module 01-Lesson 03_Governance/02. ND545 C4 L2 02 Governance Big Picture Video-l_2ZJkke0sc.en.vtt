00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
At its highest level, I think of governance as

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.465
a bridge between the organization and security.

00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:09.719
That doesn't mean that governance professionals are managing

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.020
or overseeing the rest of the GRC roles per se.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.890
It does mean that governance professionals have a higher number of

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.825
opportunities to influence a wide range of stakeholders,

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:25.305
for instance, they tend to spend lots of time

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:31.500
managing policies and procedures that focus on both security and on end-users.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.995
Like the information security policy,

00:00:33.995 --> 00:00:36.470
and also the acceptable use policy,

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.540
or if you've ever had to sit through security training and accompany,

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.715
you can thank of Governance Professional,

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:45.440
they probably created it.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.140
Now, just through those couple of examples,

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.730
you can begin to see how they influence end users.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.630
In addition to that,

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.960
there are also charged with helping to align

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.925
the security strategy with overall business strategy.

00:01:00.925 --> 00:01:04.129
Before we spend much more time talking about influence,

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.880
there is a second critical function that governance professionals play,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.965
they also measure security controls to ensure that they're operating as expected.

00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:17.585
In fact, this is a core day-to-day governance activity.

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:20.140
In future lessons, we'll talk about how

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.310
risk management professionals ensure that controls address risk,

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.075
and how compliance can influence or dictate what controls, actually, exist.

00:01:29.075 --> 00:01:33.670
But the Governance Professional in its oversight role is more

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.725
concerned with whether security controls are producing expected results,

00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:42.114
they do this by designing tests,

00:01:42.114 --> 00:01:49.270
measuring the control, and using the results to align controls with operational strategy.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.340
Let's look at a quick example.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.780
What do we mean by a control producing expected results or being effective.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.630
Imagine for a moment that your organization has a web filter mechanism in place.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.850
The organization intends to block some broad categories of websites including gambling,

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:14.230
adult themed websites, time wasting websites,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.455
or even weapon based websites.

00:02:16.455 --> 00:02:18.660
This is not an uncommon scenario,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.500
the control is the Web filter mechanism,

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.600
the job of the Governance Professional is to measure

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.505
whether or not the control that web filter is working as intended.

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:35.165
In this case, are these websites, actually, being blocked?

00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:38.320
We're not making any judgment about whether the categories are

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.825
correct or whether this creates a reduces risk,

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:44.810
the only question we're trying to answer is,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.880
are these website's blocked?

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.850
If they are, your control is producing as expected.
