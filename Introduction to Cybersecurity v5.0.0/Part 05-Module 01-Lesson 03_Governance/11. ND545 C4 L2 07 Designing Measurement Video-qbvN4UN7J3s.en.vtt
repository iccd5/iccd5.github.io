00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
Until this point, we've talked about the governance role mostly as

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.310
a conduit between the security function and business leaders and employees.

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.690
But the role does play a critical function in supporting operational security.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.965
I've mentioned it earlier during my example of the web filtering technology.

00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:20.220
Governance is responsible for providing oversight as it

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.670
relates to the effectiveness of operational security controls.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.180
Let me oversimplify the objectives for just a moment,

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.535
to illustrate that governance goal.

00:00:29.535 --> 00:00:35.355
Governance is generally not concerned with why a control exists.

00:00:35.355 --> 00:00:39.720
It doesn't talk about how the control addresses risk or compliance.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.315
It takes a more binary approach.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:48.920
It does care about what the control is and how it's supposed to function.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.825
I oversimplified before.

00:00:50.825 --> 00:00:52.640
Let's get a little more exacting.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.660
Ideally, security controls are being measured against whether they're

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.205
accomplishing their intended objective in both function and time.

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:06.710
Earlier, I said that a governance professional is not concerned with risk management.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.600
What I meant by that is that they're not concerned with the assessment of risk.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.730
What they are concerned with is,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.660
does the control appropriately address the risk it was intended to address?

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.010
In other words, they don't care about the risk being high or low,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.540
they do care if mitigation requires a control to do X,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.490
that the control effectively delivers X.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.690
That is the measuring control function.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.570
Before we talk about time,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.390
let's recap for a second on security controls.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.640
We have detective controls.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.335
Those are the controls that detect security issues.

00:01:44.335 --> 00:01:50.240
Preventive controls, they're designed to block behavior before it creates an issue;

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.170
and reactive, which are designed to allow for rapid reaction,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.050
once an issue is actually detected.

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:01.790
When we talk about measuring controls and function at a macro level,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.550
I am referring to these categories.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.500
For instance, if you're measuring traditional firewall behavior,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.574
meaning blocking or allowing ports,

00:02:12.574 --> 00:02:15.245
we think of that as preventive.

00:02:15.245 --> 00:02:17.285
At a more granular level,

00:02:17.285 --> 00:02:19.160
governance professionals are measuring

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.885
whether their preventive behavior functions as it should.

00:02:23.885 --> 00:02:25.820
Thinking about that same firewall,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.065
if it's intended to block any traffic other than traffic originating on port 443,

00:02:32.065 --> 00:02:35.750
that function is what we need to measure is the firewall

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.850
preventing traffic other than on port 443?

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.565
The other half of the control measurement process is time.

00:02:43.565 --> 00:02:45.710
What I mean by time is,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:50.000
does the control act within the time for which it was specified to act?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.045
So some examples here.

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:54.845
Is it supposed to work continuously?

00:02:54.845 --> 00:02:58.730
Is the control supposed to be always on? Is it event-driven?

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:03.995
Is the control suppose to take action when something else happens first

00:03:03.995 --> 00:03:11.425
or does it happen exactly at a specific time or within some specified time period.

00:03:11.425 --> 00:03:13.430
Let's look at our firewall again.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.615
The firewall only allows traffic over port 443.

00:03:17.615 --> 00:03:19.670
That sounds continuous to me.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.635
There's not a time qualifier.

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:25.160
What if the firewall is suppose to detect traffic over port

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.510
443 from a specific IP address and then send an alert?

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.050
That sounds event-driven to me.

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.235
What if those policies are suppose to be reviewed every Friday at 5:00 PM?

00:03:37.235 --> 00:03:39.050
That's a specific time.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.175
If the firewall policies are suppose to be reviewed once per week,

00:03:43.175 --> 00:03:46.770
that's within a specified time period.
