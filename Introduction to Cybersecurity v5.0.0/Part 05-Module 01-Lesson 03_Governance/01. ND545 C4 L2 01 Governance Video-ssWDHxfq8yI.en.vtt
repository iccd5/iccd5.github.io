00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.825
This lesson focuses on the role of security governance.

00:00:03.825 --> 00:00:06.990
This is what puts the G in GRC.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.670
Now, I'd say that

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.710
security governance professionals have the most wide ranging of all the GRC roles,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.620
because there tends to be a lot of interaction

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.015
between this role in various levels of the organization.

00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:23.190
I think you'll notice what I mean as we go.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:25.110
We'll start this lesson with

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.210
a high level overview of what governance means to the organization.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.680
Then we'll walk our way through the most important governance functions,

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.095
starting with strategic thinking, championing security,

00:00:39.095 --> 00:00:42.665
and then we'll spend the rest of our time talking about how governance

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:46.985
interacts with operational security controls in designing measurement,

00:00:46.985 --> 00:00:51.780
measurement and reporting, and policy and procedure management.
