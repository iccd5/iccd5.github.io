00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
Let's look at one other framework.

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:05.505
The FAIR Institute is a non-profit organization

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:09.615
dedicated to the discipline of measuring and managing information risk.

00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:12.765
Through that process, they've created

00:00:12.765 --> 00:00:18.810
a cyber risk management framework that focuses on measuring what they call value at risk.

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.125
Now if you're coming from a financial risk management background,

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:24.810
you're probably a little confuse right now.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.960
For everyone else, value at risk is

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.000
a financial risk management term and the two terms are not exactly the same.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.950
There's a somewhat complex explanation as to how

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:40.310
those two terms relate on the FAIR website but

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:46.415
it's probably best for me to explain that FAIR's value at risk is really aimed at one,

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:49.765
assigning value to cyber risk, and two,

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:54.310
encouraging value-based decision making for the organization.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.210
What's interesting about the FAIR approach to me is that they distinguish between

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.120
what they call implicit risk management and explicit risk management.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.940
Implicit, meaning that organizations work to align

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.440
controls to specific cybersecurity control risk management frameworks,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.510
audit against the frameworks, and remediate issues.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:22.475
The argument being that managing to a standard ensures compliance with that standard,

00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:28.180
but it doesn't necessarily address risk in context of the business.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.805
Instead, they argue for explicit risk-management,

00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:35.660
meaning that by understanding value at risk,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.840
you can define a clear risk management target,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.000
a financial target, and manage to hit that target.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.505
I absolutely agree with this approach in principle,

00:01:46.505 --> 00:01:49.139
but there are some challenges.
