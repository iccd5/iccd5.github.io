00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.625
We discussed risk treatment earlier,

00:00:02.625 --> 00:00:08.415
but we haven't yet discussed what to do after you choose a risk mitigation plan.

00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:11.955
Now, after you decide on what you want to do with the risk,

00:00:11.955 --> 00:00:15.160
you have to decide on how you're going to do it.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.250
That how are really your risk remediation activities?

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.390
Likely, this really occurs during the risk treatment process.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.290
See, during the treatment process,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.510
you're naturally going to need to discuss

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.365
various options to make an informed decision about the risk.

00:00:33.365 --> 00:00:35.345
So let's take, for example,

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:39.215
an organization's plan for building a new product.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:43.475
There might be certain security risks associated with the product.

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:45.964
During your risk treatment discussion,

00:00:45.964 --> 00:00:48.320
a risk manager decides, "Hey,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.770
the best option here is really to have

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.470
a different company to develop and host the product for you".

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.015
Now, this equates to transferring the risk,

00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:02.165
but you also have your remediation plan.

00:01:02.165 --> 00:01:07.720
Your remediation plan is that another company is going to take on the risk for you.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.750
So your risk remediation plans are designed to

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.220
track this decision-making process as the resulting activity.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.384
It should track the decision,

00:01:18.384 --> 00:01:20.685
plans for remediating risk,

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.760
and the key milestones.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.655
It's like creating a project plan for each remediation activity.

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:30.405
You may have heard the term POA&amp;M before.

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:31.830
What is it?

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.210
Well, I'll briefly mention that there's a US federal connotation to the term.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.315
It's used quite a bit in risk management for federal systems.

00:01:41.315 --> 00:01:45.595
But we mentioned creating plans of action earlier.

00:01:45.595 --> 00:01:51.905
POA&amp;Ms are supposed to be management tools for tracking the mitigation of findings.

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:57.355
So in that way, they roughly equate to what I just described as a risk register.

00:01:57.355 --> 00:01:59.505
But in federal terms,

00:01:59.505 --> 00:02:03.680
POA&amp;M should contain what we call corrective action plans.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.470
These are the specific plans that you make based

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.475
on your assessment of how risk should be treated.

00:02:09.475 --> 00:02:14.465
So the corrective action plan is a plan for how you will mitigate that risk.

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:20.245
These equate more readily to what I just described as remediation plans.

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:24.070
The reason I mentioned all of this is that it seems to me that

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.160
POA&amp;M has made its way into the common risk management vernacular.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.375
So you hear it outside of the federal government.

00:02:31.375 --> 00:02:34.595
But outside of federal risk management activities,

00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:37.640
POE&amp;Ms in corrective action plans are

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.405
often conflated to really mean the exact same thing.

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:46.040
Meaning that these become tactical approaches to remediating risk

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.995
identified during the risk assessment and that are captured in a risk register.

00:02:50.995 --> 00:02:56.255
Now, regardless of what you're actually calling risk remediation activities,

00:02:56.255 --> 00:03:00.930
it's vastly important that you continue to keep track of those.
