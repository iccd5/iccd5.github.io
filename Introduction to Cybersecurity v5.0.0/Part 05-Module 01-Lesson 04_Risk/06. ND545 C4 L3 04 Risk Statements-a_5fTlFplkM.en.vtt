00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Let's take a closer look at how we express risk,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:04.335
not how we measure it,

00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:05.925
but how we express it.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:07.320
One of the concepts,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:13.275
that new risk managers often have difficulty with is accurately describing risk.

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:15.810
We've shown a couple of examples already.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.560
That description is referred to as a risk statement,

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.450
they should be a few things,

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.280
they should be concise,

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.230
they should be specific,

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.340
judgment free, and action focused.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.590
The idea is that we describe a risk behavior or outcome without

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.185
prematurely assessing the risk or making judgments about the state of a control.

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:44.315
For instance, risk; there is no firewall.

00:00:44.315 --> 00:00:46.485
Is that really a risk?

00:00:46.485 --> 00:00:48.575
It sounds to me like a risk,

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:50.975
but it really isn't specific enough.

00:00:50.975 --> 00:00:56.215
It's focused only on a control and it doesn't mention any potential outcome.

00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:58.695
Let's look a little closer at this.

00:00:58.695 --> 00:01:02.860
Granted, not having a firewall is going to present risk,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:04.670
many risks in fact,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.170
but the statement fails to meet the objective of a good risk statement.

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.620
Good risks statements help make sure that stakeholders share

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.820
a common understanding of a problem so that they can, actually, remediate it.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.654
Let's think about that bad risk statement,

00:01:19.654 --> 00:01:21.440
that there's not a firewall.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.625
I just bought a firewall and then I installed it on my network.

00:01:25.625 --> 00:01:27.730
Does that eliminate any risk?

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.890
It's certainly the opposite of not having a firewall,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.470
but I haven't configured it to do anything,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.960
I don't think that it really eliminates any risk at all to just buy one.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.945
Now, to help us out,

00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:46.130
the US Department of Defense released a risk issue and management guide in 2017,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.975
and it lists the elements of a proper risk statement.

00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:55.655
The DoD says, "The risk statement contains the potential event or condition,

00:01:55.655 --> 00:01:58.535
the consequences, and if known,

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.220
the cause of the event."

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.390
I like this because it really serves as

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.300
a step-by-step process to building effective risk statements.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.675
Let's look at three examples.

00:02:09.675 --> 00:02:16.025
We've got the DoD definition for risk statement here at the bottom, just for reference.

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:19.630
What about this first risk statement?

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.590
Is it good? Bad actors may be able to exploit weak encryption versions

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.705
supported by web servers in order to read sensitive data in plain text.

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:32.290
It meets two of our criteria.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.630
It has the potential event or condition and the consequences.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.855
Now, let's look at our second example.

00:02:38.855 --> 00:02:45.260
Because SSL version 3 is supported on all externally facing corporate web servers,

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.600
bad actors may be able to exploit

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.360
weak encryption versions that are supported

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.270
in order to read sensitive data in plain text.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.690
Now, is that a proper risk statement? It is.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.250
It actually, meets three out of the three criteria,

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.830
it contains the potential event or condition,

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.080
the consequences, and the cause of the event.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.225
Let's finally look at the third example.

00:03:08.225 --> 00:03:11.155
Web servers support SSL version 3,

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:14.690
this really only contains one piece of information,

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.960
so it's not a proper risk statement.

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.760
The goal of restatement is that they're

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.955
used to perform risk assessments throughout the organization.

00:03:22.955 --> 00:03:27.440
What we haven't yet talked about how to determine what risks should be assessed?

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.930
We can start to think about sources for risk statements.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.085
Before assessing a system,

00:03:34.085 --> 00:03:35.930
you could sit down and try to think of

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.590
all the risks that might potentially affect the system.

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.395
But risk managers or assessors,

00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:46.760
usually, rely on just a few sources for risks statements.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.620
They can come from things like existing organizational risk registers,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.145
from old external audits or assessments,

00:03:55.145 --> 00:03:58.075
or from various risk frameworks.

00:03:58.075 --> 00:04:01.650
Let's talk about some of those risk frameworks.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.205
In general, these are

00:04:04.205 --> 00:04:08.525
industry guidelines intended to standardize the practice of risk management.

00:04:08.525 --> 00:04:12.725
I like to think of them as falling into one of two categories.

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:15.980
Category 1 is process focused.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:19.070
Those are frameworks that mainly focus on

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.735
establishing a well-developed risk management process.

00:04:22.735 --> 00:04:27.080
Then category 2 are more risk statement focused.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.100
These are guidelines that create a process for risk management,

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.980
but they also establish clearest statements to accomplish their brand of assessment.

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.920
We're going take a look at two of these frameworks right now.
