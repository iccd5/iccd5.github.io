00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.585
Let's take a look at FAIR in context.

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.390
FAIR provides a free tool on their website where

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.660
anyone can perform a value at risk assessment.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.490
I think when time permits,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.870
you should spend some time familiarizing yourself with it.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:16.755
We're going to take a brief look at it here.

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:22.729
Now, we're going to do that using the tool sample risk assessment of a fishing exploit,

00:00:22.729 --> 00:00:25.100
which has resulted in some data loss.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:30.295
In the tool, you can create a guided analysis of a potential loss of it,

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:33.905
you do that in the loss event frequency cluster.

00:00:33.905 --> 00:00:36.860
Here you're going to inner variables like,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.710
how often you expect a loss event to occur,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.645
or how many times that you think a risk might be exploited,

00:00:43.645 --> 00:00:46.340
and you can even enter things like,

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.095
how sophisticated an attack might need to be in order to be successful.

00:00:51.095 --> 00:00:55.190
You'll do that here in the threat capability section.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.850
Now, all of those factors are going to

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.810
be weighed against your anticipated loss per event,

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.370
that occurs in the loss magnitude cluster.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.630
What you'll want to weigh is both your primary loss and your secondary losses.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.465
That's where I think we need to be really careful.

00:01:14.465 --> 00:01:16.340
We're attempting to estimate first,

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.289
how much a record costs,

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:24.880
and then second, what regulatory or customer reactions might be to our loss.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.710
For instance, are we going to get fined by an agency or are we going to lose a customer?

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.985
I think both of these things are extremely difficult to estimate.

00:01:34.985 --> 00:01:37.340
If you review this example,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.970
our primary losses, actually, look pretty low.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.530
These are losses associated with customer records or customer data.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.629
But our secondary risks,

00:01:47.629 --> 00:01:50.770
those are really high, those are substantial.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.510
This is where we've estimated again,

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.910
the cost of loss of a regulatory fine or customer reaction.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:08.125
So what we end up with is an annualized loss scenario of up to $7.1 million.

00:02:08.125 --> 00:02:11.990
As you can see, this is really substantial and

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.989
that's where I think we need to be ultimately very careful,

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.775
I'm going to explain why now.

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:19.190
Now, as I mentioned, I think that type of

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.835
loss exposure seems really high for most organizations.

00:02:22.835 --> 00:02:26.410
As you know, we see organizations being breached all the time,

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:31.145
and it's hard to imagine that too many companies could sustain a few loss events,

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:35.015
the total millions of dollars in losses every single year.

00:02:35.015 --> 00:02:38.165
One of the reasons it sounds high, I think,

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:43.625
is because it's difficult to assign a value to a piece of data or a single record.

00:02:43.625 --> 00:02:47.345
You may have spent only a few $100 acquiring a customer,

00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:52.280
but the same customer may be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue,

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.865
are the customers collective records worth hundreds of thousands of dollars,

00:02:55.865 --> 00:02:59.315
or the records really without value and it's

00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:03.710
just the customer itself that represents value to your organization.

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:06.340
How much is public sentiment worth?

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.300
We know that high profile breaches,

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.395
like the target breach,

00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:12.065
didn't appear to affect sentiment over time.

00:03:12.065 --> 00:03:14.270
Now, we saw a slight drop in

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:19.480
target stock price following the public disclosure of their breach.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.370
But the stock return to fresh highs just weeks later and it really hasn't slowed down.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.000
That's the chart here on the right.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.860
Finally, as it relates to value at risk,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.520
this analysis can be time-consuming.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:39.085
It can be time-consuming to create realistic value assessments.

00:03:39.085 --> 00:03:46.180
Security controls aren't really ever applied evenly across specific risks in a system.

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.430
So even if you nail the value at risk assessment,

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.190
it might be difficult to say that you've addressed

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.895
that risk by implementing a targeted control.

00:03:55.895 --> 00:04:01.580
Firewalls, for example, aren't normally implemented to control a single risk,

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:04.975
but they control risks across the organization.

00:04:04.975 --> 00:04:08.360
This doesn't mean that value at risk is without value,

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.395
it does mean that I think it's probably too complex and

00:04:12.395 --> 00:04:18.000
too time-consuming to be your primary method of assessing risk.
