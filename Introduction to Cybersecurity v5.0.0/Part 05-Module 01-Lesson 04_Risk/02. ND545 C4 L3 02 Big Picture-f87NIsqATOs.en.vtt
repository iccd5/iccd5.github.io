00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.435
Out of every concept that we've talked about in this course,

00:00:03.435 --> 00:00:08.610
risk is the one that I'm confident that you already understand.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.530
Everyone assesses risks on

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.315
a day-to-day basis as a reflection of whether something is prudent or not.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:18.915
For instance, is this thing safe to eat?

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:20.910
Is it safe to fly today?

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.990
Should I buy this stock or should I pet this dinosaur?

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.500
In these cases, you are doing a quick calculation about a number of factors in your head.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.395
It's simple decision-making, and in theory,

00:00:33.395 --> 00:00:36.520
you tend to choose the best or safest option.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.630
But sometimes you choose to take

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.550
a riskier approach because of some sort of a perceived reward.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.250
It's probably not safe for instance,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.975
to pet the dinosaur.

00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:51.010
But think about the bragging rights that you'd have.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.420
That's the essence of risk management.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.330
Let's talk for a moment about our friendly dinosaur.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:00.220
We've asked, is it safe to pet the dinosaur?

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.665
But what we're probably asking ourselves,

00:01:03.665 --> 00:01:05.510
if I get close enough,

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.445
will the dinosaur bite me?

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:10.835
There are two components of the bite that we're really assessing.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.990
What is the likelihood that the dinosaur bites me?

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.010
Then what's the impact if it does?

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.070
This is how we really express risk.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.150
Risk is a function of the likelihood of something

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.295
occurring and the impact of the event once it occurs.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:32.845
Now, I suspect that risk management has been a part of human history really forever,

00:01:32.845 --> 00:01:36.335
and I attribute that to our survival instinct.

00:01:36.335 --> 00:01:42.970
We assess risk in our daily lives and act based on some determination of benefit to self.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.920
But there is additional historical context that you

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.890
should be aware of when discussing risk-management.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.130
Modern-day risk management principles are built on

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.840
a number of theoretical mathematical principles.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:03.005
Probability for instance, has its roots in 16th and 17th century study of mathematics.

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:05.930
Probability or chance roughly

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.870
equate to what I've described as the likelihood that an event might occur.

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:15.320
This really began with mathematicians studying games or chance,

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.040
creating mathematical equations to identify the likelihood

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.930
that an event might occur in rolling dice or playing cards.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:26.120
Today you see mathematical evaluation of likelihood

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.840
frequently in places like financial institutions,

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.630
investment, insurance risk management,

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.999
and other areas where understanding

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:39.040
the likelihood of an occurrence requires exacting precision.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.495
Security risk management however,

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:47.285
tends to describe likelihood in terms of qualifiers like high, medium, or low.

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:50.010
We'll discuss that more in just a bit.
