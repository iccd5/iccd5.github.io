00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.485
Before we go too much further describing security GRC functions,

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:07.170
let's take a quick look at security controls

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.410
since I've referenced those controls a couple of times now.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.900
Now generally, if asked,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.600
you want to say there are three types of

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.465
security controls: detective, preventive, and reactive.

00:00:21.465 --> 00:00:25.220
Some people talk about other security categories and they

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.880
might be called something along the lines of management controls.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.325
But typically, I like to talk about these three major categories.

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:35.000
In fact, I think most of the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.140
management controls roughly fit into the preventive category.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.800
Detective controls are controls that are designed to detect ongoing risks or threats.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.945
Some of the examples of these controls are things like intrusion detection systems,

00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:54.560
user-behavior analytics, or even log management.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.270
Preventive controls?

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.805
Those are designed to block bad behavior out of the gate.

00:00:59.805 --> 00:01:02.235
Some examples of preventive controls?

00:01:02.235 --> 00:01:06.080
Things like firewalls or web application firewalls.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.105
Then there are reactive controls.

00:01:08.105 --> 00:01:10.865
These are designed to allow you to react,

00:01:10.865 --> 00:01:12.610
to detect the threats.

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.455
Some of those examples are things like

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:20.735
incident response plans or manual or triggered network isolation systems.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:22.850
Now bringing it all back.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.555
Now that we've added a little context to the control discussion,

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:30.065
I want you to keep this in mind as we go throughout the course.

00:01:30.065 --> 00:01:32.750
But I will say most of the time we'll spend

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.110
discussing how GRC roles interact with the organization,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.820
each other, and security controls.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.390
But we won't actually be spending a lot of time

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.450
talking in detail about these controls themselves.
