00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.895
Ideally for the solution to this exercise,

00:00:02.895 --> 00:00:06.300
I'd like to see you write something like this,

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.530
that Swift Tech is searching for a GRC analyst.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.640
This individual will be expected to partner with various stakeholders,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.395
such as business leaders in

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:20.745
IT resources to align security strategy with business strategy.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.370
That successful candidate will also be

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.535
involved in the development of policies, procedures,

00:00:26.535 --> 00:00:30.000
and training measures to assist the organization in reducing

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.245
risk and to support the development of a secure organization.

00:00:34.245 --> 00:00:36.705
All governance tasks.

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:39.800
The individual should also be able to deliver

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.625
communication effectively to various constituencies,

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:47.300
whether through the development of Polish training deliverables,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.555
or reports to operational security stakeholders

00:00:50.555 --> 00:00:54.095
as they relate to the outcomes from security control testing.

00:00:54.095 --> 00:00:59.700
All of these items are vital for the security governance professional.
