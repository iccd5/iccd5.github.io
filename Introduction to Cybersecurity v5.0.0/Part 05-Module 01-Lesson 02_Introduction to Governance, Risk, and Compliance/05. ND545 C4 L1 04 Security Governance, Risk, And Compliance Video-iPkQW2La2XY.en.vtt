00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
We've talked about a definition for operational GRC,

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.615
and we've broadly talked about some of the differences

00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:10.245
between operational GRC and security GRC.

00:00:10.245 --> 00:00:13.830
But I think it's time we reach a definition for security GRC.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.855
Now, I happen to like the OSG definition of GRC.

00:00:18.855 --> 00:00:23.190
I think we can modify that to show the more tactical approach that

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.740
security GRC requires and then still demonstrate support for the organization.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.240
Let's try this. Cybersecurity GRC is

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.600
the integrated collection of capabilities that enable

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.845
an organization to set and meet strategic goals,

00:00:40.845 --> 00:00:45.240
that's governance, to address existing and emerging threats,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.740
that's our risk, and then finally to meet our obligations,

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.975
that equates to compliance.

00:00:51.975 --> 00:00:53.825
All of those, of course,

00:00:53.825 --> 00:00:56.150
as they relate to security.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.405
That definition, I think gets us to a more tactical view of the organization.

00:01:01.405 --> 00:01:03.225
Now what do I mean by that?

00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:06.260
What do I mean specifically about tactical?

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.860
Security GRC functions generally center on security controls.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.295
While the mission of security GRC is to support the organization.

00:01:16.295 --> 00:01:19.310
Day-to-day activities are focused on ensuring

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.435
the operational effectiveness and efficiency of controls that support that mission.

00:01:25.435 --> 00:01:27.710
By controls, of course,

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.205
I mean actual security controls, firewalls,

00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:33.410
data loss prevention mechanisms,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.195
authentication, policies, and procedures, and more.

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:41.795
Now, how are we supporting the business mission as GRC professionals?

00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:44.060
Here are a couple ways. Every time you

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.460
hear about a high-profile breach, what do you think?

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.275
You think that something failed.

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:49.640
We don't think, "Wow,

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.910
those hackers must have been amazing."

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.360
We think the company failed,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.250
and sometimes that's the case.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.055
Here are a couple of examples.

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:01.955
Take for instance, the May 2017 breach of Booz Allen Hamilton.

00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:04.700
They reportedly exposed battlefield imagery and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.115
other sensitive account information all by an unsecured AWS S3 bucket or

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:13.820
the 2015 breach of the OPM that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.360
resulted in approximately 21.5 million records being stolen.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.630
Now the government believes that was the result of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.185
social engineering like a phishing attack.

00:02:23.185 --> 00:02:29.750
Either of these issues may have been discovered before breach with healthy GRC practices.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.650
That is how GRC supports the business's overall mission,

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.820
by helping to avoid control failure that leads to costly mistakes.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.810
Now, that isn't to say that GRC would solve every potential breach before it occurs.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.414
But in these cases,

00:02:46.414 --> 00:02:52.520
security GRC may have identified controls that weren't working effectively,

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.065
might have identified the risks that could have led to better controls,

00:02:57.065 --> 00:03:00.110
or had compliance obligations that would have

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.110
created a control to solve these challenges as well.
