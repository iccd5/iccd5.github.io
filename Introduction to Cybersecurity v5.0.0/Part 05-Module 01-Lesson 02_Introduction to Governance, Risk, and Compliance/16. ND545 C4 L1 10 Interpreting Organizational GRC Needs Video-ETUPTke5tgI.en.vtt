00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.315
Every organization has unique needs.

00:00:03.315 --> 00:00:05.610
They have their own way of doing business,

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.859
their own operational strategy,

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.855
their own IT strategies,

00:00:09.855 --> 00:00:11.835
and their own security posture.

00:00:11.835 --> 00:00:16.290
Because of that, I tell folks that are just starting out their GRC careers that

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.685
you almost need to know the business better than it knows itself.

00:00:20.685 --> 00:00:26.700
Now, what I mean by that is that there are no one size fits all security controls,

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.639
and there aren't any one size fits all GRC strategies.

00:00:30.639 --> 00:00:35.405
Instead, you must work within the context to the business.

00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:39.230
Security GRC really does provide the support structure and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.640
oversight for the security mechanisms that protect each business.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.270
But knowing how to apply GRC concepts to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.575
unique business profiles takes a good deal of practice.

00:00:51.575 --> 00:00:53.450
Let's take, for example,

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.485
a relatively common organizational scenario.

00:00:56.485 --> 00:00:58.610
Your organization has a bunch of

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.315
servers that are really behind their patch management schedules.

00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:07.310
What do you do? What if I told you that those applications,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.360
that those servers support are scheduled to go away within a year,

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.155
does that change your answer?

00:01:13.155 --> 00:01:16.520
What if I told you that they were scheduled to go away in six months?

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.100
What about that? Does that change your answer?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.310
Or what if I told you they were scheduled to go away in 10 days?

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:29.820
That's just an example of how business context can change what you do as a GRC analyst.
