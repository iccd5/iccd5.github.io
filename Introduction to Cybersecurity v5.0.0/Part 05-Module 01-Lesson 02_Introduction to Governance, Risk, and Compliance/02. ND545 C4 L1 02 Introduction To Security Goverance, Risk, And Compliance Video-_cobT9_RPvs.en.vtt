00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.275
You probably have some rough idea of what GRC means.

00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:08.925
In literal terms, GRC stands for governance, risk, and compliance.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:10.725
But what does that mean?

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:12.465
Now if I asked you,

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:15.165
how would you want to run your business?

00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:19.225
You're probably going to tell me you want to be mission-oriented,

00:00:19.225 --> 00:00:24.035
hyper-focused on your goals and strategy. You want to be shrewd.

00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:25.730
You want to make sure that you don't make

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.335
bad decisions and you take advantage when you can.

00:00:29.335 --> 00:00:31.040
You want to be trustworthy.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.470
You want your customers to trust

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.460
that you're doing the things that you need to do as a company.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.155
Everything we just described is GRC.

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:43.475
You can roughly translate business goals into

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:47.135
individual components of governance, risk, and compliance.

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:51.585
Mission-oriented, that focus on the mission and strategy,

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:54.735
well, that equates roughly to governance.

00:00:54.735 --> 00:00:57.500
Shrewdness, the idea that you want to make

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.440
well-founded decisions, that's risk management.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.000
Trustworthiness, making sure that you do the things

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.580
that you're expected to do as a company, well, that's compliance.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.960
We'll talk more about the individual components throughout the course,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.460
but I want to make sure that everyone has a really clear understanding of GRC

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.535
at this macro level before we talk more about security GRC specifically.

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:24.650
We just talked about how certain business goals roughly

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:28.160
translate to GRC functions at a macro level.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.710
But remember, in this course,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.554
we're going to be discussing four broad topics of security governance,

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:38.230
risk, and also compliance.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.440
What that means is security governance specifically,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.385
security compliance, and security risk management.

00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:52.240
We'll also spend time talking about security assessments and how they fit in.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.730
Now, you're probably wondering at this point though,

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:01.640
what's the real difference between GRC at that macro level and security GRC?

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.210
In general, security GRC is more tactical

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.385
than what I would call traditional or operational GRC.

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:13.070
We'll talk more about that historical contexts in just a moment,

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.185
but for now, I would think of security GRC as tactical.

00:02:17.185 --> 00:02:22.085
Meaning that mission-oriented really becomes a question

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:27.140
of whether security is acting in a manner that supports our business goals.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.890
Shrewdness becomes a question as to whether we're making good decisions about security.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.930
Trustworthiness now asks what security is actually required of our organization?

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.140
You can see how the questions relate to the original business goals,

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.180
but now we're really asking,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.030
how does security support business objectives?
