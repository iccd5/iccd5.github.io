00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.674
We started out with a high level-picture of GRC,

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:07.710
and then I briefly demonstrated how security GRC relates to it.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.690
I'd like to zoom back out though for

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.125
just a few minutes to create some additional context.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:20.205
Now we just concluded that security GRC is more tactical than GRC at a high level.

00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:24.205
That high level, I describe as operational GRC,

00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:26.070
that's where I want to start.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.110
Let's start with operational GRC before we get specific about security GRC.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.305
The core components of GRC have been part of business for some time.

00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:39.005
We talked about some of our business goals before,

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.760
but GRC as a practice,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.600
has really emerged over the past 30 years.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.430
In fact, the first book dedicated to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.540
operational risk management wasn't even written until the 1960s.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:52.730
But things evolve pretty quickly.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.460
In large part, the practice has matured because of

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.685
widespread fraud and widespread business failure.

00:00:58.685 --> 00:01:02.240
Some of that maturity driven by regulation and some of

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:07.400
that maturity driven by businesses just being more prudent and planning for resilience.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.250
Now the timing of that maturity really makes sense.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:16.135
Historically, we've seen major crises in financial events drive regulatory change.

00:01:16.135 --> 00:01:18.825
After the Great Depression, for instance,

00:01:18.825 --> 00:01:24.905
we had the creation of both the FDIC in 1933 and the SEC in 1934.

00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:27.920
Then, in the early 2000s,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.650
we see the tech bubble burst,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.370
and then we also see one of

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:36.155
the largest financial scandals in history leading to Enron's bankruptcy.

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:42.670
Those events then lead directly to the passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, in 2002.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.650
That, of course, established sweeping changes to audit

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.190
financial regulations for publicly traded companies.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.795
Now at the same time,

00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:54.590
you've got groups like the Open Compliance and Ethics Group,

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:58.555
or OCEG, being founded in 2002.

00:01:58.555 --> 00:02:02.615
They're founded as a think tank focused on the practice of GRC.

00:02:02.615 --> 00:02:05.360
This again is in direct response to

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.620
the same fraud that led to the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.500
Their purpose, to build a framework for professionals to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.350
ensure organizations are operating both effectively and efficiently.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:21.200
Let's look at what the OCEG says about GRC.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.430
They define it like this,

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:27.680
"GRC is the integrated collection of capabilities that

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.835
enable an organization to reliably achieve objectives,

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:35.820
address uncertainty, and act with integrity."

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.140
Now, thinking back to our business goals that we laid out before,

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.035
this definition maps directly to them.

00:02:42.035 --> 00:02:43.770
But there is a disconnect.

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.515
It's not one of OCEGs making,

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:50.255
but one of the goals of their model is to break down

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:54.745
organizational silos and manage the business holistically.

00:02:54.745 --> 00:02:57.650
If you think about all the processes necessary

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.500
to ensure a business is operating at peak efficiency,

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.210
you'll see that they all flow together to make up one system.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:07.760
But you have something else happening in the early 2000s,

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:12.490
companies are starting to rapidly embrace technology of all kinds.

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.295
The challenge that's created is that technology

00:03:16.295 --> 00:03:20.780
can't be viewed in the same way other business processes are viewed.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.560
Business operations operate differently than financial management.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.405
IT operations operate differently than security.

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:30.695
If you take audit, for instance,

00:03:30.695 --> 00:03:36.784
you wouldn't audit financial records in the same way that you would assess IT systems.

00:03:36.784 --> 00:03:41.375
As a result, you end up with a historical split between

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:47.195
operational GRC and what is commonly referred to as IT GRC.

00:03:47.195 --> 00:03:50.675
One of those is focused on business,

00:03:50.675 --> 00:03:56.060
and one of those is focused on the systems that support the business objectives.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.560
Now functionally, this division still persist

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.725
with security GRC making up a large share of IT GRC.

00:04:05.725 --> 00:04:07.755
There is a small caveat.

00:04:07.755 --> 00:04:13.910
The GRC industry, particularly GRC software and service providers,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:20.485
often talk about operational GRC and IT GRC as a single holistic function.

00:04:20.485 --> 00:04:26.975
One of the reasons for that is the pervasiveness of IT as part of every business process,

00:04:26.975 --> 00:04:28.700
or what we call today,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.060
the digitization of business.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:34.295
Security GRC has gained prominence

00:04:34.295 --> 00:04:38.465
because of security's importance in successful IT operations,

00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:42.395
and the potential for customer impact as security plays

00:04:42.395 --> 00:04:46.465
a really large role in establishing trust with customers.

00:04:46.465 --> 00:04:49.550
We, however, will continue to talk about

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:55.440
security GRC and operational GRC as completely separate entities.
