00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.925
We're here to talk about cybersecurity,

00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:04.890
governance, risk, and compliance.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.700
In this lesson, we'll be covering four main topics.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.715
All of them related to giving you a high level overview of GRC as it relates to security.

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:19.765
We'll briefly distinguish security GRC from an overall GRC context.

00:00:19.765 --> 00:00:21.785
We'll define GRC roles,

00:00:21.785 --> 00:00:25.800
we'll talk about ways that each area of GRC is interrelated,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.725
and finally, we'll discuss how to interpret

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:32.890
organizational GRC needs. So let's jump into it.
