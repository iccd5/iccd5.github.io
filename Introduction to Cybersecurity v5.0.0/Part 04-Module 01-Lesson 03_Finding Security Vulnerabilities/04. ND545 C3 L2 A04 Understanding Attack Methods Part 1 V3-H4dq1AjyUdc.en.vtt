00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
Attacks usually follow a standard process.

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.735
As you work to identify vulnerabilities,

00:00:06.735 --> 00:00:09.450
understanding this process can help you know

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.805
how attackers take advantage of your weaknesses.

00:00:12.805 --> 00:00:16.110
The first step is reconnaissance.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.970
The threat actor conducts research to find as much information as possible,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.235
on the target they want to attack,

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:27.090
including finding vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.734
During this phase, they might be collecting e-mail addresses,

00:00:30.734 --> 00:00:34.499
identifying employees on social media networks,

00:00:34.499 --> 00:00:37.260
finding public server information,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.310
scanning for security holes,

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.030
and anything else that can help them learn about the target.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.585
Next is weaponization.

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:51.395
Here, the threat actor creates or acquires the arsenal for attack, such as malware.

00:00:51.395 --> 00:00:52.910
So during this phase,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.550
they might be writing malware code or pulling

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.840
together existing malware resources for use.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.860
The next step is delivery.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.100
The weapon is launched against the target and the operation begins.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.750
During this phase, they might send an e-mail that includes the malware,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.795
or share the malware on a USB stick,

00:01:14.795 --> 00:01:18.320
or setup a malicious website, or other options.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.200
Then exploration begins.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:26.920
So here the threat actor must take advantage of a vulnerability to gain access.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.140
During this phase, they are leveraging the weapons that they've

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.335
created to exploit vulnerabilities.

00:01:33.335 --> 00:01:38.470
So these might be exploits against software, hardware, or people.

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.190
Remember we talked earlier about those different kinds of attacks.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.815
The sixth step is installation.

00:01:45.815 --> 00:01:49.070
The threat actor might install a backdoor or

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.200
create ways to keep their access for the attack.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.499
So here they may install a web shell on a web server,

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:01.070
or add services such as auto-run keys.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.715
Next is command and control.

00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:09.175
Here, the threat actor enables remote control and manipulation of the target.

00:02:09.175 --> 00:02:13.660
So they may open two-way communication channel infrastructure,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.140
likely over web, DNS, or e-mail protocols.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.480
The last piece is action on objectives.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.405
Here, the threat actor accomplishes their mission and completes the attack goal.

00:02:26.405 --> 00:02:29.575
Finally, they do whatever they intended to do.

00:02:29.575 --> 00:02:31.495
So for this part of the attack,

00:02:31.495 --> 00:02:33.670
it could be stealing data,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.255
escalating privileges, destroying a system,

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:38.890
or whatever their goal was,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.170
and then it starts all over again.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:44.320
It's important to know that a threat actor may go through

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.510
this cycle several times during one attack,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.735
and it may not always happen in this direct sequence.

00:02:50.735 --> 00:02:55.160
There can be loops and times when an attacker strikes out at one stage,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.650
for example, and has to go back.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.910
Now, you know the key steps in the cyber attack process.
