00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.835
This is the MITRE Attack Framework.

00:00:02.835 --> 00:00:08.850
So it's a globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:12.360
real-world observation and there's so much rich insight in

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.275
this framework that comes from a variety of intelligence sources.

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:19.215
Now, I will walk you through the framework at a high level here,

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:25.425
but also encourage you to take some time to click through a few more areas on your own.

00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:32.100
Now, the top column headers in the gray bar along the top signify

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.215
the different goals of the threat actor

00:00:35.215 --> 00:00:39.710
during various parts of the attack while the rows underneath,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.560
so the white boxes with blue text in them,

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.860
show the attack tactics that are commonly used to achieve those goals.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.225
So each one of these provides a ton of rich context around these attack methods.

00:00:53.225 --> 00:00:55.310
So if you're wondering, let's say,

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.505
how an attacker might gain initial access to our system.

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:00.605
That's this section over here.

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:04.205
If you click on "Initial Access," you'd see more information

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:07.900
on this attack method, the definition here.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.005
So you can see it's an adversary trying to get access to your network, pretty basic.

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:13.460
If you scroll down,

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.920
you see the different techniques that attackers can

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.785
use to accomplish this and descriptions.

00:01:18.785 --> 00:01:21.230
So they could do a drive-by compromise,

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.680
they can use external remote services and so on.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.680
Let's pick one to dig in a little bit more.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.965
Let's say we want to explore how attackers can use valid accounts to gain initial access.

00:01:33.965 --> 00:01:35.810
If we click into that one,

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.170
you'll see even more information.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.310
Here's a definition of what it is,

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.805
and it continues to get into greater detail below but basically,

00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:48.170
if an attacker is trying to use valid accounts to get initial access,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.110
they're using different techniques to capture

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.915
credentials and so on through social engineering to get access.

00:01:54.915 --> 00:01:57.410
On the right side of the screen here,

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.320
you can see more details about this tactic.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.280
So everything from some descriptive terms that are used

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.035
to what platforms does this apply to and more information here.

00:02:09.035 --> 00:02:11.464
If you keep scrolling down,

00:02:11.464 --> 00:02:13.490
you'll see procedure examples.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.450
So these are real examples where threat actors have

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.085
used this attack method of using valid accounts to gain initial access.

00:02:22.085 --> 00:02:25.505
You can see some of the tactics and things they've used.

00:02:25.505 --> 00:02:29.305
For example, let's look at APT39,

00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:31.355
is the name of this one.

00:02:31.355 --> 00:02:35.530
They have used stolen credentials to compromise Outlook Web Access.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.525
If you wanted to look even further into how they did this,

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:43.790
you would click on this group and you can see a ton of more information about them.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.670
You learned more about these groups in lesson 1.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.935
So we won't go into too much detail here,

00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:51.320
but you can learn so much about the groups who

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.155
have carried out attacks using that method.

00:02:54.155 --> 00:02:57.990
So a long list here and so much information.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.350
If you continue to scroll down the page,

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.480
you then get to a lot

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.715
more helpful information around mitigation techniques and detection.

00:03:06.715 --> 00:03:08.450
When we say mitigation,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.255
we mean now that we know that this attack method exists,

00:03:11.255 --> 00:03:14.840
like what are the different ways to mitigate that and to avoid it.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.620
There are recommendations here on everything from making sure that

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.160
sensitive credentials are not stored in an insecure ways

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.030
to auditing source code and so on and you

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.385
can even click into each of these options to get more information.

00:03:30.385 --> 00:03:34.790
Then finally, scrolling down to detection and resources.

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.440
So from a detection standpoint,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.225
this is telling you,

00:03:38.225 --> 00:03:43.250
how do I know that this attack tactic is being used in my network?

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.495
How do I detect it?

00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:46.700
So there's tips on how to do that.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.790
Then this references area is golden,

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.760
because here you can really start to do additional research and look

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.260
into more detail on various artifacts and various resources.

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.330
So a wealth of information here and I want to call out as we go back to

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:07.430
the main page that we only clicked into one box and got all of that information.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.085
So when you see how many different boxes are here,

00:04:10.085 --> 00:04:12.470
that can give you a sense of just how

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.390
detailed your research can get when you're looking into these attacks.

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.790
The last thing that I'll call out is this Get

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.770
Started resource here is another super-helpful thing to look into.

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.660
So here you have blog posts,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.240
you have starter videos that can really help you dig into

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.460
this framework a lot more and learn some additional details.

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.550
That is the MITRE Attack Framework.
