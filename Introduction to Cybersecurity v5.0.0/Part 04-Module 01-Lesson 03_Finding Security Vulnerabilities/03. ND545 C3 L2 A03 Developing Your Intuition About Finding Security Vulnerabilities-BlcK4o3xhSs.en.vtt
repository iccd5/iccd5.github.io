00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.215
Vulnerability is our security holes or weaknesses.

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:07.620
The bank vault door I mentioned earlier should

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.175
not automatically open after 10 failed attempts.

00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.830
That creates a vulnerability.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.780
You deal with these in everyday life as well, an unlocked car,

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.635
an open house door and unattended backpack,

00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:26.010
a broken window or scenarios where

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.080
vulnerability can allow someone to break in and steal valuable items.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.365
In cybersecurity, vulnerabilities can surface as missing updates,

00:00:37.365 --> 00:00:41.450
software flaws, improper error handling,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.205
and many other types.

00:00:43.205 --> 00:00:46.205
Let's take error handling for example.

00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:52.565
You want to make sure that system errors don't fail in a way that helps threat actors.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:55.774
If a user enters in the wrong password,

00:00:55.774 --> 00:00:59.585
does the system respond in a way that can help an attacker?

00:00:59.585 --> 00:01:02.735
If so, that's a weakness in the system.

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:06.680
Take a look at these two login error pages,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.805
which do you think would help an attacker?

00:01:09.805 --> 00:01:12.500
If you look closely at the error messages,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.980
the first one discloses that the ID the user tried to enter is not yet taken.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.870
If you start entering different IDs until that message doesn't show up,

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.940
then you know that you've been able to guess and enter an ID that's valid,

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.415
and now you just need a password.

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:35.390
The second error message exposes less vulnerability

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.815
because it doesn't tell the user much about what they've entered incorrectly,

00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:42.570
and so they have to start from scratch.
