00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.965
While many different threats,

00:00:01.965 --> 00:00:04.440
threat actors and scenarios exist,

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.545
they typically follow a similar process.

00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:10.950
It's called a cyber attack kill chain.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.590
It's important to understand that process so that

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.470
as you seek to find security vulnerabilities,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.040
you have a good understanding of how attackers might use them against you.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.660
I spent a significant portion of my career doing just

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.454
this and manage the process of scanning corporate environments,

00:00:28.454 --> 00:00:32.820
looking for security issues and working with people to fix them.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.020
It's an important job and I learned so much in

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.220
the process about just how many security issues are out there and

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.640
how it's a never ending process of finding and

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.185
fixing with new curve balls thrown at you every single day,

00:00:48.185 --> 00:00:49.625
which keeps it interesting.

00:00:49.625 --> 00:00:51.230
So during this lesson,

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.820
you'll learn all about the process of how to find security vulnerabilities.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.650
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.250
you'll be able to leverage the miter attack framework to understand the attack methods,

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.345
configure and launch scans to find vulnerabilities,

00:01:07.345 --> 00:01:11.705
and also explain the steps required to conduct a penetration test.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:14.010
Let's go over these now.
