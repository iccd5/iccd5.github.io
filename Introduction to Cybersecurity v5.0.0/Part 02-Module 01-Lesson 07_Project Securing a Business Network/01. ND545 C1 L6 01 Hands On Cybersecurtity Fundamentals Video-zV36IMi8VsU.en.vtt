00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.860
Congratulations, you have been asked by your buddy Joe to fix

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.230
his PC that he uses at his auto body shop, Joe's Auto.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.440
Joe asked you to investigate how to secure the PC he uses for business. You see?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.940
Previous employees used it for things not related to business such as personal email,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.760
social media, and even playing games.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.155
Now he wants to use it for his sensitive and critical business information,

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:29.805
so your job is using

00:00:29.805 --> 00:00:34.490
industry best practices and what you learned in this class to secure it.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.100
The process of analyzing and applying

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.585
security techniques happens daily in workplaces around the globe.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.510
What you're doing in this project is what I

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.535
do on a daily basis as a cybersecurity professional.

00:00:48.535 --> 00:00:51.710
This product gives you the opportunity to apply what

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.325
you've learned in the course by investigating a Windows 10 PC,

00:00:55.325 --> 00:00:58.280
securing it, and then explaining what you

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.980
found and what you've done in your security report.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.470
The same skills you use to secure one machine here is the

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.180
same you can use to secure thousands in a large organization.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.860
Have fun with this project.
