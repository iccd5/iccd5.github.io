00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
As a part of this project,

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.780
you are given a document template that contains

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.235
the high-level steps you'll take as part of securing a typical computer system.

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:11.280
You should use the Virtual Windows 10 PC to answer

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.790
the questions and challenges listed in this project document.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.910
You can see here the different steps you should

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.035
take in securing the sample Windows 10 PC.

00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:26.820
For each step, you need to write your answers in this document template.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.015
For example, when you're performing reconnaissance,

00:00:30.015 --> 00:00:35.670
type in the hardware device name that you see on Joe's PC,

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.175
explain how you got your answers,

00:00:38.175 --> 00:00:42.010
and also provide screenshots showing your work.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.290
By the way, you don't get a document like this in real life,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.540
it's often a report that you'll need to develop and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.795
complete from scratch for each of your clients.

00:00:50.795 --> 00:00:54.785
Let me show you quickly how to take a screenshot in Windows.

00:00:54.785 --> 00:00:57.580
I use the Snipping Tool,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.565
this is native with Windows 10 or you can use the new Snip &amp; Sketch.

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:04.290
To create a screenshot,

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.300
click on new with the Snipping Tool,

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.930
it will then open a box where you can then highlight what you want to capture.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.240
I'm just going to take some random text and you can see it on the screen.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.135
At this point, I can use the copy function and copy it directly into documents.

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:24.520
I use Snipping Tool many times throughout the day.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.055
It's important that you read through the entire document

00:01:28.055 --> 00:01:31.970
before securing the system and completing your report.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.140
Let me finish by giving you some tips and advice for this project.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.474
This project is based on instruction you received throughout the course.

00:01:40.474 --> 00:01:43.730
It takes you through the NIST Cybersecurity Framework,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.490
the CIS controls, and the Hacker Lifecycle.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.440
If you get stuck, go back to that section in the course and review the material.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.140
It's important that you write each of the steps you

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.275
take and use screenshots to show your work.

00:01:57.275 --> 00:02:00.050
You should keep in mind that there are numerous ways to

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.260
solve each of the challenges in the project.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.005
You should use the method you're most comfortable with

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:09.215
rather than worrying about getting the right answers.

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:13.160
That's why it's important to show your work in your report.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.010
Don't worry about getting all of the answers,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.340
there are many security problems with this sample PC.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.220
The intent is to give you a challenge based on what you've learned

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.320
throughout this course and what you'll see in real life.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.115
Last, have fun with this.

00:02:29.115 --> 00:02:31.250
Use this time to explore,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.715
learn, and try new things.

00:02:33.715 --> 00:02:36.990
Good luck and have fun with the project.
