00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
Congratulations, you've successfully completed this course.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.720
The course on GRC as it relates to cybersecurity.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.810
Now, let's go over some of what we learn together.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.715
In our GRC overview,

00:00:11.715 --> 00:00:16.575
we learned what GRC is and then what security GRC is,

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:20.970
we then define specific GRC roles for our organization,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.815
we talked about how each of those roles interrelate, and then finally,

00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:28.770
we discussed how GRC professionals must be

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.265
able to interpret their organizations GRC needs.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:37.035
In governance, we talked about what governance is for the organization.

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:40.650
We learned that governance professionals act as a bridge

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.850
between the business and security through strategic thinking,

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.070
and that they act as a bridge between security

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.970
and the rest of the organization championing security through end-user training.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.050
Then we learned about one of the most critical functions of

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.355
the governance organization, designing control measurement.

00:01:00.355 --> 00:01:05.240
We talked about how to measure those controls and the report out on results.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.635
Then finally, we talked about how to build security policies and procedures.

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:13.670
In risk management, we understood how to manage risk.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.800
We also talked about how to practice risk management in your organization,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.530
and we talked about how risk management actually

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.850
operates in a cybersecurity organization today.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.675
In compliance, we discovered some of the origins of compliance.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:33.620
We also talked about what compliance is and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.805
the obligation sources that create compliance for organizations.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:42.020
We also talked about how to evaluate those obligations horses for

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.780
your unique situation and how to perform

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.655
control assessments against your compliance obligations.

00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:51.690
Finally, in audit fundamentals,

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.165
we talked about how to manage audits appropriately for your organization,

00:01:56.165 --> 00:02:01.260
and we talked about how to deal with the follow-up and remediation.
