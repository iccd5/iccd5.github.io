00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
Audits and assessments really do have the ability to set

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.235
an organization security strategy for an entire calendar year.

00:00:07.235 --> 00:00:11.880
The reason for that is audits are designed to root out failure,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.945
your goal is to expose where the organization is failing.

00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:19.050
That probably sounds a little counter-intuitive.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.890
We've spent our whole life trying to avoid admitting failure or

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.155
mistakes and here we might be paying for someone to find as many as possible,

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:30.405
it sounds like a scary proposition.

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:33.480
Imagine being responsible for operational security for

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.105
a company and an auditor finds hundreds of security failures.

00:00:37.105 --> 00:00:38.520
It happens all the time.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.055
But that's why this section is so important.

00:00:41.055 --> 00:00:42.830
As a GRC professional,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.690
you have a responsibility to manage audits in a way that makes them productive,

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.260
non-threatening, and without too many surprises.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.265
If managed properly, they'll help set strategic direction,

00:00:55.265 --> 00:00:59.000
set budgetary needs, prove compliance with standards,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.780
and expose control weakness or failure.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.540
As explained earlier, it's certainly better to expose failure

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.320
in an audit rather than as part of a customer assessment.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.735
Before we talk about how to manage audits,

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:14.510
it's important to understand that there are many different types.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:20.135
We're not talking about how the audits originate or the goals,

00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:23.855
but we are talking about how the audits are actually performed.

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:28.220
They're question-based assessments, meaning that you'll be answering

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.695
questions about controls and often providing supporting documentation.

00:01:32.695 --> 00:01:37.400
They're technical assessments aimed at looking at technical security controls,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.100
only either automated or otherwise,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.335
thinking about things like code reviews or vulnerability and penetration tests.

00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:48.140
There could also be fully manual assessments,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.240
things like configuration settings,

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.990
again, code reviews, or where we see this a lot is reviewing policies and procedures.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.785
There are also interviews,

00:01:57.785 --> 00:02:03.065
meaning literal interviews of IT personnel and business stakeholders,

00:02:03.065 --> 00:02:06.035
and then finally, there're onsite assessments,

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:09.595
which could literally mean any of the things that we just discussed.

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:12.515
Let's put some of what we just learned to work.

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:15.170
A customer wants to perform an audit.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.410
They want to assess whether the security mechanisms you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.175
have in place to support them are functioning as expected.

00:02:22.175 --> 00:02:27.690
Now they've requested to perform a penetration test and a vulnerability assessment.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.705
What kind of assessment are they asking to perform? That's right.

00:02:31.705 --> 00:02:34.545
Both of these appear to be technical assessments.

00:02:34.545 --> 00:02:36.735
The big question, however,

00:02:36.735 --> 00:02:39.880
is will you allow the customer to perform the test?

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.535
We've already said that some customers

00:02:42.535 --> 00:02:45.760
have contractual rights to assess your security environment,

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.050
but it's part of your role to understand exactly what they've contracted to do.

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.580
It's also important to understand

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.285
what standards the customer is planning to assess you against.

00:02:58.285 --> 00:03:01.630
What if the customer is planning to assess you or

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.135
your controls against a really strict standard,

00:03:05.135 --> 00:03:08.055
maybe one that your organization doesn't follow?

00:03:08.055 --> 00:03:10.575
That's where you can really get into some trouble.

00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:14.010
One last point here, what if this were a prospective customer?

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.460
Chances are you're not going to allow

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.090
prospective customers to assess your environment because it's

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.120
going to create the opportunity for non-customers to make

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.585
demands of the organization without any future obligations.

00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:31.890
All of these things are things that you'll need to consider when you're managing audits.
