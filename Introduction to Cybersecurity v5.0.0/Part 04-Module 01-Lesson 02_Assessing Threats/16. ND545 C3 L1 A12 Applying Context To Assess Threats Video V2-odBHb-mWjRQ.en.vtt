00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
Up to this point of the assessment,

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.470
you have identified threats,

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.450
you've created threat profiles,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.940
and any other artifacts to document

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.630
information so that you can start analyzing each threat.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.720
Until now, you can conduct impact assessments

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.185
and apply context to start prioritizing threats,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:21.060
which is the ultimate goal here.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.205
This process will vary depending on the company, for example,

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:28.890
I've worked with one company who preferred to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.480
prioritize threats solely on financial impact to the company,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.850
while another chose to prioritize based on the ones that were

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.225
most likely to impact critical operations and customer safety.

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:45.740
No matter what approach is taken,

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.540
it's good to have a standard way to evaluate threats.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.585
In this basic example,

00:00:51.585 --> 00:00:55.595
the threat is evaluated based on potential impact,

00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:58.225
which can be defined many different ways.

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:04.010
It also considered likelihood of that impact being realized from this threat,

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.210
and what controls are in place to mitigate the threats.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.470
Let's say you profiled three threats,

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.705
and need to know which one you should be most concerned about.

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:21.815
You can see in the example matrix that threat 2 has high impact, meaning, for example,

00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:25.640
this threat could cost the company millions of dollars versus

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.460
something that might be rated low if the cost is under $10,000.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.130
Threat 2 also has a high likelihood of

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.230
occurring with a low amount of existing security controls.

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.900
A low amount of controls could mean the system is missing

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.635
encryption or it doesn't have up-to-date security patching.

00:01:45.635 --> 00:01:47.670
Whereas something rated high in

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.990
security controls might have all of those security measures in place and more.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.250
Because the impact and likelihood of the threat are high and the controls are low,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.335
threat 2 is of greater concern than threat 3, for example,

00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:07.055
where they'll be impact and likelihood are high,

00:02:07.055 --> 00:02:10.205
there are more controls in place to mitigate them.

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:13.130
Threat 1 is rated low all across,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:15.605
so that's not the greatest concern here.

00:02:15.605 --> 00:02:17.825
Based on this threat process,

00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:21.855
you may conclude threat 2 is the greatest threat.

00:02:21.855 --> 00:02:25.190
In many organizations, this information is

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.945
what feeds the next steps in the risk management process.

00:02:28.945 --> 00:02:34.985
As you create the different categories that you use to evaluate threats,

00:02:34.985 --> 00:02:40.780
and determine how you want to score or rate what's low or what's high,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:46.410
those parameters should match up to your risk assessment process as well.
