00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
A threat is a possible danger that could exploit

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.865
a vulnerability despite controls to breach security and cause harm.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:10.455
Let's break that down.

00:00:10.455 --> 00:00:12.210
Let's say, for example,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.790
I leave for work in the morning and locking

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.635
my front door is a security control that I use to keep bad things out.

00:00:19.635 --> 00:00:23.670
But let's say I accidentally left my back window open.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.465
Contrary to what most people believe,

00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:29.000
the window being open is not a threat,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.055
this is a vulnerability.

00:00:31.055 --> 00:00:33.335
It's a gap in my home system.

00:00:33.335 --> 00:00:38.465
But just because a window is open doesn't mean there's a breach just yet.

00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:41.420
There would need to be someone or something

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.060
ready to take advantage of the window being open,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.620
and in other words, exploits the gap in order to make this an issue.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.315
That outcome of actions taken by the person or a thing whether it's

00:00:53.315 --> 00:00:58.280
a burglar or a rogue snake that slithers through the window,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.520
that is what is considered the threat.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.785
Understanding threats is a subset of risk management.

00:01:05.785 --> 00:01:07.940
This is important to call out because

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.945
successful threat assessment relies on risk management information.

00:01:11.945 --> 00:01:16.175
For example, in the identifying phase of the risk management process,

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.290
you are not only identifying threats,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.390
you are understanding what assets are present in the company.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.945
During this process, some questions you might ask are,

00:01:26.945 --> 00:01:29.540
what are the important processes?

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.170
What are the important data points?

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.700
All of this information will help you when you start aiming to identify threats.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.945
For example, if through risk management you've identified that

00:01:41.945 --> 00:01:44.900
your systems store data on majority of

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.185
the presidents and global leaders around the world.

00:01:48.185 --> 00:01:50.345
When you start identifying threats,

00:01:50.345 --> 00:01:53.265
you can take this into consideration.

00:01:53.265 --> 00:01:57.410
Who might want this data? What could they use it for?

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.845
What bad things can happen if they got it?

00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:03.290
Once you've identified the threats,

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.395
similar to what we discussed with the bees, snakes,

00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:08.170
and jellyfish on the beach,

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.780
you take these various factors into consideration so that you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.260
can start to prioritize and focus on what matters most.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:21.120
This information then goes back and feeds the rest of the risk management process.
