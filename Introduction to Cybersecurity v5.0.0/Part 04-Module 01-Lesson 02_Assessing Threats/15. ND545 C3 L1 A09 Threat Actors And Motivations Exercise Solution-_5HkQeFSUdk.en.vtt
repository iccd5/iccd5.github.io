00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
Here you are analyzing the threat scenario image to

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.470
identify the threat actors and potential motivations.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.360
There are two individuals in the image and both are considered threat actors.

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.725
Remember that threats can be internal or external,

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.455
and they can be intentional or unintentional.

00:00:19.455 --> 00:00:24.765
In this case, it appears that Holly is an external malicious hacker,

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:28.755
while Mary is an oblivious insider threat.

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:32.940
Determining motivation is an art more than a science.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.720
Sometimes you have to do research and hypothesize.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.985
Based on the information available,

00:00:38.985 --> 00:00:43.225
it seems Holly is a financially motivated cyber criminal.

00:00:43.225 --> 00:00:48.485
We know that she targeted the finance executive and she sent

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:55.045
a link to a fake login page to potentially steal Mary's login credentials.

00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:58.325
We don't know yet what she may be trying to do with that,

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:01.690
but you can start to get a sense of what she might be up to.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.895
Another thing to consider here is that sometimes

00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:10.140
external and internal threat actors may collaborate to carry out attacks.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.340
It's important to keep that in mind when thinking about

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.555
the behavior and potential motivation of threat actors.

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:22.440
Don't rule threat actors out without thinking about this.
