00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
Using the illustration of the home window that's left open,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.629
we know that while the vulnerability exists,

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.610
we have to consider the threats.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.790
A threat can be categorized in several ways.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.025
A threat can be intentional,

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:16.050
it can be unintentional,

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:21.210
or otherwise circumstance, capability, action, or event.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.900
A thief planning to climb through the window and rob the place is an intentional threat,

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.360
while a snake seeking shelter on a hot day could be an unintentional threat.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.655
While the snake may scare some people,

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:37.920
it's not intentionally planning to hurt anyone,

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.915
it's just looking for shade.

00:00:39.915 --> 00:00:43.250
If it starts thunder storming and water drenches

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.825
your new computer that happens to be sitting on the desk next to the window,

00:00:47.825 --> 00:00:50.980
that is a circumstantial threat.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.715
Now bringing this back to the cyber world,

00:00:53.715 --> 00:00:57.020
an intentional threat might be a cyber criminal

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.470
trying to hack a system while an employee who

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.680
accidentally sends an e-mail with sensitive information to

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.675
the wrong contact could be an unintentional threat.

00:01:07.675 --> 00:01:10.870
Finally, a threat of circumstance could

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.630
be a wildfire that destroys all of your company's data.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.350
While each of these threats can be seen in different lights,

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.480
they each can still expose a company to grave danger.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.825
Threats don't only come from malicious hackers.

00:01:25.825 --> 00:01:28.600
Majority of security breaches involve

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.650
human error that often stems from a company's employees.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.080
For example in 2018,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.490
it was reported that an employee from Punjab National Bank caused the company

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.290
to lose $1.8 billion, not millions, billions.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:46.780
To do that, he organized the issuance of

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.010
fake loan requests which prompted two banks to provide those loans to PNB.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.845
The employee admitted to having

00:01:53.845 --> 00:01:57.070
unauthorized password access to their financial systems to

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.320
issue those fraud documents and he even

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.215
shared the credentials with others outside of the company.

00:02:02.215 --> 00:02:07.850
This is a real example of how insider threat happens and it happens very often.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.540
There are tons of external threat examples as well.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.895
One is Unitypoint Health.

00:02:13.895 --> 00:02:17.690
In 2018, the company released a report that it was hit

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.455
with one successful breach from an external attacker,

00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:23.150
but it didn't end there.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.850
The company became a honeypot and

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.255
attracted even more hackers to try and breach their systems.

00:02:29.255 --> 00:02:30.875
The first time around,

00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:38.105
a successful phishing attack resulted in the loss of 16,000 patient records.

00:02:38.105 --> 00:02:41.615
But in its second breach within that same year,

00:02:41.615 --> 00:02:45.950
the company was hit with more targeted phishing e-mails that led to the loss of

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.530
1.4 million patient records on individuals.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.465
Though the external threat is obvious in this case,

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:58.110
this example interestingly enough has threats on both ends.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.140
Not only is the external party that sent the phishing e-mail a threat,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.855
but the internal employee who clicked the link to enable the attack is a threat as well.

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:14.180
Before cyber attackers hack into a system or technology,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.975
they usually target and leverage human beings first as we saw in the last example.

00:03:19.975 --> 00:03:26.455
As a result, roughly 80 percent of attacks are enabled by social engineering.

00:03:26.455 --> 00:03:31.760
Social engineering is an attempt to trick someone into revealing information

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.600
such as a password that can be used to infiltrate systems or networks.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.390
They are usually disguised as something nice or

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:45.610
helpful to the target like a sheep in wolf's clothing.

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.700
Phishing for example, is a technique for attempting

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.750
to acquire sensitive data such as bank account numbers through

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.310
a fraudulent solicitation in an e-mail where the perpetrator

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.045
acts like a legitimate business or reputable person that you can trust.

00:04:04.045 --> 00:04:07.350
There are other variations like vishing,

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.780
in which it's like phishing,

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.065
but it's executed through voice call, or smishing,

00:04:14.065 --> 00:04:19.395
which is executed through SMS or text message.

00:04:19.395 --> 00:04:24.875
These attacks against people are usually an enabler to executing

00:04:24.875 --> 00:04:31.865
other technology-based attacks such as delivering ransomware or malware to a victim,

00:04:31.865 --> 00:04:36.190
conducting password attacks, and so much more.
