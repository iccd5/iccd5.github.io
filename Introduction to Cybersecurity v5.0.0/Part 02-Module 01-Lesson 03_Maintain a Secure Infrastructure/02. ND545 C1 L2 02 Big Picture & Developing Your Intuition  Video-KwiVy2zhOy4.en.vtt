00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
It's important for you to know the rules governing cybersecurity,

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.820
since you'll be in a position where you'll have to make sure

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.780
you and your organizations are following those rules.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.000
In this lesson, we'll talk about influential organizations that develop and maintain

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.865
the standards used by companies worldwide to defend data, computers, and networks.

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:23.460
There are organizations responsible for setting

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.220
the standards in the US and internationally.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.910
There are also once the focus on specific areas.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.440
In the United States,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:35.399
that organization is the National Institute of Standards and Technology,

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.420
also known as NIST.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.719
The International Organization for Standards, or ISO,

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.245
works with the International Electrotechnical Commission,

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:49.640
or IEC, to set worldwide technology standards.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.900
There are also governing bodies that set the rules for specific areas.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.335
For example, the Payment Card Industry, or PCI,

00:00:57.335 --> 00:01:00.530
has their data security standards that are required for

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.585
any businesses accepting or handling credit card data.

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:06.570
Why do we need these rules?

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.620
First, it's for safety,

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.310
to make sure technology doesn't cause problems for people or other technologies.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.110
For example, you may have seen

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.135
the UL symbol on light bulbs or other electrical appliances,

00:01:19.135 --> 00:01:23.120
underwriter's laboratory is sanctioned to make sure anything plugged into

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.445
an electrical socket doesn't cause problems: like a fire or a short.

00:01:27.445 --> 00:01:29.625
In IT and cybersecurity,

00:01:29.625 --> 00:01:32.990
we also have standard bodies like the ones I just mentioned.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.770
For the same reason to make sure anything plugged

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.930
into a network doesn't cause problems for other devices on the network.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.945
We also have these standards to make sure technology plays well together.

00:01:44.945 --> 00:01:47.405
If everyone talked to different language,

00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:50.540
we'd have a difficult time understanding each other.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.220
Same with technology.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.625
To allow technology interconnectivity.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:59.315
It's also to make sure everyone is playing by the same rules.

00:01:59.315 --> 00:02:01.655
This is known as compliance.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:07.179
Organizations often have auditors checking to make sure the rules are being followed.

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.380
Lastly, and possibly most importantly, it's for efficiency.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.110
If you know the rules and have a playbook to follow them,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.670
then it's easier, faster,

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:18.795
and cheaper for you to implement technology.

00:02:18.795 --> 00:02:21.850
Knowing the rules and how they can be implemented helps

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.900
you anticipate what's needed for cybersecurity.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.000
You can help your organization prepare for audits.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.290
It's like knowing the answers on a class's final exam on the first day of class.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.670
You'll know the questions the auditors will be

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.460
asking before they ever get a chance to ask them.

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.130
You can help your organization be proactive with its cybersecurity,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.730
which also reduces its risks,

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.890
saving time, and money.
