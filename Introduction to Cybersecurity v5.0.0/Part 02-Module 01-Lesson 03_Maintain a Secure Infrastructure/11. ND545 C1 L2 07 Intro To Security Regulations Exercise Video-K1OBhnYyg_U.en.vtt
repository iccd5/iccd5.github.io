00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.680
For these units exercise,

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.260
you reviewed the nest special publications.

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.305
These are documents you'll reference regularly,

00:00:07.305 --> 00:00:09.330
as a security professional.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.965
Let me show you what they look like.

00:00:11.965 --> 00:00:14.325
For part 2 of the exercise,

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:22.450
you should have gone to the csrc.nist.gov/publications/sp800 series document.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.760
As you can see, there are so many of over

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.975
200 that have been created over the last 25 years.

00:00:29.975 --> 00:00:33.410
For the exercise, you should pick a couple to explore,

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.450
read what they have inside of them.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.790
For example, if we were to look at the first one,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.540
general access control for Cloud systems.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.335
So what does this mean?

00:00:42.335 --> 00:00:45.290
Well, if an organization is using something in the Cloud,

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.030
like with AWS or Azure or the Google Cloud.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.855
This is how they control access to it.

00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:55.835
These are the rules and regulations that you can follow.

00:00:55.835 --> 00:01:01.250
You can read a lot more about it within the abstract and including the keywords.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.390
Another special publication I wanted to call out,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.915
is the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education,

00:01:08.915 --> 00:01:11.495
the Cybersecurity Workforce Framework.

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:17.010
This is the rules for overcoming that cyber security skills gap.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.230
It's an international initiative in order to help people into

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.305
the cyber security career and help employers

00:01:24.305 --> 00:01:27.980
find the right people for their cyber security programs.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.545
Take some time to look through the NIST special publications 800 series.

00:01:33.545 --> 00:01:38.400
You'll be using them throughout your cybersecurity career.
