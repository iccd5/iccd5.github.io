00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
For security to be done right,

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:05.745
it takes high-level planning led by organizational leaders.

00:00:05.745 --> 00:00:08.475
They need to set the rules for everyone to follow,

00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:11.895
which is known as governance and compliance.

00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:16.050
This section explains these terms and how policies are

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.925
used as a form of communicating corporate governance and enforcing compliance.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:24.135
Necessary evils in the world of security.

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.655
Let me explain some of these terms.

00:00:26.655 --> 00:00:30.990
The governance of cybersecurity is a strategic planning responsibility that

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.655
provides oversight of company information systems, operations, and activities.

00:00:35.655 --> 00:00:41.440
This is done by setting organizational policies and establishes practices to enforcement.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.060
The compliance requires all affected parties follow the same rules.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.775
Tied to these terms is auditing,

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:52.820
an independent review and examination of records and

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.940
activities to assess the adequacy of security

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.880
and system controls to ensure compliance with

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.329
established policies and operational procedures.

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.220
Let me give you an example.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.610
When you're working, what you browse,

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.600
where you're allowed to go on the Internet, that's the governance.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.125
Limiting availability of what sites you can go to

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:19.085
using business computers, that compliance.

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:23.720
Checking your Internet history that may be considered auditing.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:29.855
All of these areas intermingle within businesses and are often done behind the scenes,

00:01:29.855 --> 00:01:33.770
but are critical terms as a part of a cybersecurity program.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.540
Now I get it. All this policy and governance stuff is boring,

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.010
especially when compared to fun topics like ethical hacking.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:45.005
However, establishing, maintaining, and following

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.715
organizational policies is the bedrock of a good security program.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:54.190
They provide the written directions that everyone in the organization should follow.

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.655
Without them, it's chaos.

00:01:56.655 --> 00:02:02.105
Policies are formal statements or rules that specify correct or expected behavior.

00:02:02.105 --> 00:02:05.480
For an example, an acceptable use policy explains

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.885
the rules for using the company's information systems.

00:02:08.885 --> 00:02:11.810
Whether you're a client or an employee,

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.630
you need to be able to consistently enforce

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.275
these policies improve compliance to an auditor.

00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:23.165
Also, policies must be written and accessible by those who need to comply.

00:02:23.165 --> 00:02:28.570
In the exercise, you'll look at some policies that are affecting you right now.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.200
So why should you care about governance, compliance, and auditing?

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.340
Well, it affects your life and you may not even realize it.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.935
When you first start working at a company,

00:02:39.935 --> 00:02:42.645
they'll have you read all of their policies.

00:02:42.645 --> 00:02:45.560
Why? Because they expect you to follow them

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.160
from day one throughout your whole term as an employee.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.985
Ignorance is no excuse.

00:02:51.985 --> 00:02:54.795
Even as a client or consumer,

00:02:54.795 --> 00:02:58.670
we're shown policies or end-user license agreements and are

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.885
expected to follow them even if we sometimes just want to click through and ignore them.

00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:05.480
Also, as a cybersecurity professional,

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.895
you very well may have the role of writing,

00:03:07.895 --> 00:03:10.865
updating, or enforcing those corporate policies.

00:03:10.865 --> 00:03:14.720
Lastly, often auditors are used to validate that

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.700
organizations are following the rules and have the right amount of security in place.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.410
You very well may need to work with them or you may even be one as part of your career.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.055
Having solid governance in place saves time, money,

00:03:28.055 --> 00:03:33.390
and resources, and creates a better culture of security.
