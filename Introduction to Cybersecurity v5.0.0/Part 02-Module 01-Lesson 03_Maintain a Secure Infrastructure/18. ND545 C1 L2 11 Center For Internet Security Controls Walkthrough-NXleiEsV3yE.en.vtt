00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.685
For this exercise, you'll practice using the CIS controls using a case study.

00:00:05.685 --> 00:00:09.630
This is meant to replicate a real-life scenario you very well may

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.025
encounter as a cybersecurity professional. Here's the story.

00:00:14.025 --> 00:00:17.940
Jill &amp; Roy provide accounting services throughout their area.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.445
They employ seven full-time workers,

00:00:20.445 --> 00:00:22.330
which is four accountants,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.745
an office administrator, and of course themselves.

00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:30.050
They also have about a dozen seasonal workers during the tax season.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:36.590
They use Microsoft products such as Office 365 for their office applications like e-mail,

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.930
word processing, and spreadsheets.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.685
But for their accounting,

00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:42.660
they use into it QuickBooks,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.450
ProConnect, the online version.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.509
For their network, they have a single Linksys,

00:00:48.509 --> 00:00:51.210
Ethernet, switch, and router.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.475
The full-time accountants each have a Lenovo ThinkPad,

00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:59.650
while the office administrator has a Lenovo desktop.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.240
All company workstations use the latest version of Windows 10.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.370
Everybody has admin privileges on their PC,

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.125
which means anyone can install whatever software they need.

00:01:11.125 --> 00:01:14.870
They also have an additional Windows 10 Lenovo desktop they

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.700
use for their print and file servers that sits in the main office area.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.810
Now, keep in mind, only Roy and Jill and the office

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.550
admin have an account on that one server.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.455
Now, the temporary workers,

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:29.735
they use their own laptops,

00:01:29.735 --> 00:01:32.455
which are a mixture of Windows and Macs.

00:01:32.455 --> 00:01:36.100
Additionally, the office has a bring-your-own-device policies.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.565
That means all employees just use their own smartphones or cell phones.

00:01:40.565 --> 00:01:44.720
They have a contract with a local IT company that comes in

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.589
about once a week or two that does the weekly backup,

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:49.900
the file print server,

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.025
and does any updating or any maintenance of the systems.

00:01:54.025 --> 00:01:57.980
For each of the CIS controls listed in the exercise,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.690
provide your interpretation of how they may apply to Jill &amp; Roy's accounting.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.860
You should use the CIS controls website to help you answer these questions.
