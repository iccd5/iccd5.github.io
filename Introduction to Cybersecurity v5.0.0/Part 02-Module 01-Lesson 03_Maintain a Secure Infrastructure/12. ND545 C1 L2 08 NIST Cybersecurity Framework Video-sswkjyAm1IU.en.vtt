00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.550
To help simplify the process of maturing an organization's cybersecurity program,

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.825
the NIST Computer Security Resources Center or CSRC,

00:00:09.825 --> 00:00:12.465
created the Cyber Security Framework,

00:00:12.465 --> 00:00:14.115
also known as CSF,

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:20.625
that can be applied to any type of organization no matter its size, sector, or type.

00:00:20.625 --> 00:00:26.175
Any US federal agencies or contractors are required to follow the NIST CSF.

00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:31.200
We found that many non-government organizations also follow it to be compliant with

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.900
an industry standard and reduce the risks of a security violation or a data breach.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.255
This section will help you recognize each of the components of the NIST CSF.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:46.310
The NIST CSF helps organizations identify,

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:48.935
manage, and assess their cyber risks.

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:51.415
It has three main parts.

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:57.155
The core, which is an easy-to-understand set of cybersecurity goals.

00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:01.130
Implementation tiers are how an organization

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.270
manages their cybersecurity risks and profiles,

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.689
which is a list of the organization's unique requirements,

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.595
objectives, risk tolerance, and resources.

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:15.905
Just as maturity is important for human growth,

00:01:15.905 --> 00:01:18.455
we need it for IT and cybersecurity.

00:01:18.455 --> 00:01:22.805
More mature means less effort and time and greater protection.

00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:25.250
The framework tiers describe how

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.720
an organization functions as it relates to cybersecurity technology,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.345
management, and operational practices.

00:01:32.345 --> 00:01:36.200
The CSF tiers range from partial tier

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.930
1 and describe an increasing degree of maturity in their cybersecurity program.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.160
For example, a company just starting a cybersecurity program with

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.130
a lot of procedures or technologies would be tier 1 or partial.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.850
A company with advanced cybersecurity program that can quickly adapt to

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.985
new situations and efficiently make cybersecurity risk decisions would be tier 4.

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:05.300
Where does your organization fall in these tiers?

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.040
How mature are they?

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.815
You'll be able to understand organizational maturity by the end of this course.

00:02:12.815 --> 00:02:16.610
The CSF core is an underlying structure of

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.190
a mature security program organized into high-level functions and categories.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.220
This is like an architectural drawing for a house,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.060
showing how a security program can be built.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.650
It's designed to be easy to use,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.440
allowing a common language between the security team,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.885
IT, and business leaders.

00:02:35.885 --> 00:02:38.435
The core consists of three parts;

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:43.385
functions, categories, and subcategories.

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:47.945
The core includes five high-level functions: Identify,

00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:52.980
protect, detect, respond, and recover.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.720
The categories fit within each function and give

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.285
direction on security controls, implementation, and management.

00:03:01.285 --> 00:03:05.930
The last part of the NIST CSF triad are organizational profiles.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:09.560
These are basically the road map for your security program.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.610
We use profiles to understand where we need to improve

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:19.610
our cybersecurity programs by comparing a current profile with a target profile.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.275
It's like that road map where you are now to where you want to go.

00:03:23.275 --> 00:03:27.005
Your profile is a written explanation of your organizations,

00:03:27.005 --> 00:03:31.880
unique requirements, objectives, risk tolerance, and resources.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.520
It shows where you are versus where you need to improve.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.740
The NIST CSF tiers, core,

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.890
and profile provide direction on implementing

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:49.830
a compliance security program that manages its cybersecurity risks to acceptable levels.
