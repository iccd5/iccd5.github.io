00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Let's put what you've learned about encryption to the test practically.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.660
If I would like to send you a letter that absolutely no

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.645
one but you needs to see and it must travel publicly,

00:00:09.645 --> 00:00:12.780
for instance courier or post office, how could we do it?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.780
Here are the materials we have on hand.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.040
We have the letter,

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:17.705
a small box with a loop,

00:00:17.705 --> 00:00:19.325
think tiny pirate chest,

00:00:19.325 --> 00:00:21.200
and we each have a lock.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.340
Step 1, I put the letter in the box and put my lock on it.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.125
Only I have the key.

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:29.075
I send you the box.

00:00:29.075 --> 00:00:30.665
You receive the box,

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.185
but you can't open it because my lock is on there.

00:00:33.185 --> 00:00:35.195
However, you add your lock,

00:00:35.195 --> 00:00:38.950
which only you have the key to and send the box back to me.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.585
I receive the box,

00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.850
I can't open it because your lock is on there.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.400
But I can remove my lock and send it back to you.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.154
You receive the box,

00:00:48.154 --> 00:00:50.585
remove your lock and read the letter.

00:00:50.585 --> 00:00:52.040
If you would like to respond,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.450
you just reverse the steps.
