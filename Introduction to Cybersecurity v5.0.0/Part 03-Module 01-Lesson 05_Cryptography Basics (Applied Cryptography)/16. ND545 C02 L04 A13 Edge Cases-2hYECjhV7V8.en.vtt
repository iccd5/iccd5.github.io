00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
In general, there are few, if any,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.515
edge cases for not using encryption.

00:00:04.515 --> 00:00:07.770
With performance being at or near unencrypted levels,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.020
it makes sense to encrypt everything.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.750
One item comes to mind that is still not quite

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.495
where it needs to be with encryption, and that's e-mail.

00:00:15.495 --> 00:00:17.640
It was not designed to be secure.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.970
There are many moving parts, various clients, servers,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.965
devices, and ISPs involved,

00:00:22.965 --> 00:00:25.230
and those may or may not support encryption.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.960
You have to find a way to share your public key,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.610
and if it's by e-mail,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:32.160
that has to be unencrypted, at least to begin with.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.025
Generally, only the attachments are encrypted,

00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:36.810
not the body of the e-mail.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:38.940
If the person receiving the message has

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.320
poor operational security and leaves their phone unattended,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.215
the information is easily leaked.

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:45.750
Encryption fatigue.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.740
It isn't uncommon for senders and recipients to get fed

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.175
up trying to use encrypted e-mail and revert back to plain texts.

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:53.540
Having said all that,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.010
if personal or sensitive data is being transmitted and you are a compliant organization,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.300
you must use encryption.
