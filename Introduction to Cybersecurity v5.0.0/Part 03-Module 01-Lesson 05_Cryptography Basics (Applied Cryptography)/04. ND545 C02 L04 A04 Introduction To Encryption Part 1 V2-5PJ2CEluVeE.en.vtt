00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.945
In this section, we'll learn the basics of encryption.

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:05.835
By the end of this section,

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:08.145
you will understand what encryption is,

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:11.415
differentiate different types of encryption techniques,

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:15.314
and determine the appropriate encryption type for a given scenario.

00:00:15.314 --> 00:00:19.185
Where does encryption fit in our three component model of security?

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.955
It fits in prevention.

00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:23.070
So what is encryption?

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.335
In cryptography, encryption is the process of taking data that is plaintext,

00:00:28.335 --> 00:00:30.090
meaning anyone can read it,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.440
and converting it via a mathematical algorithm into ciphertext.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.380
Only authorized parties with

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.010
the appropriate key can reverse the process and view the data.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.055
What is the earliest encryption you can think of?

00:00:43.055 --> 00:00:45.634
While not considered to be true encryption,

00:00:45.634 --> 00:00:50.060
there is evidence of modified hieroglyphic characters to enhance the words and

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.660
phrases used in tombs of noblemen in Egypt as early as almost 4,000 years ago.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.785
In ancient Greece and Sparta, a scytale,

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:03.845
which is a length of parchment wrapped around a specifically size cylinder was used.

00:01:03.845 --> 00:01:05.780
Once the parchment was wrapped,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.415
a message was written on it.

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:10.220
Each commander had the same size cylinder.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.969
If the parchment were wrapped on an incorrectly size cylinder,

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:15.725
the message was unreadable.

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:18.065
While this could be easily compromised,

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:21.995
the information on it was generally time-sensitive battle messages,

00:01:21.995 --> 00:01:23.785
thus proving very effective.

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:26.555
Lastly, and perhaps most famously,

00:01:26.555 --> 00:01:28.490
nearly 2,000 years ago,

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.870
Roman Emperor Julius Caesar used what's known as the Caesar cipher.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.450
The variant used by Caesar was a shift by three cipher,

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.430
each character was shifted by three places.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.490
So the character A was replaced by D,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.460
B was replaced by E, and so on.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.800
The characters would wrap around at the end,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.065
so X would be replaced by A.

00:01:51.065 --> 00:01:55.050
We'll take a look at the Caesar cipher in action in a bit.
