00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.875
Let's use our heart or an intuition to solve this data breach case.

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:06.900
You have alerts set up on

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.935
several dark websites for information related to your organization.

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:13.170
You receive an alert that has a list of

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.485
documents that appear to have originated within your company.

00:00:16.485 --> 00:00:20.670
Your first thought is you have been attacked and your systems have been breached.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.720
You quickly notify management and shift into incident response mode.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.860
You scour the trail from outside your organization all the way to

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.540
the database the data resides on looking for openings, none detected.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.315
You know your database is encrypted as is the storage it resides on,

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:41.195
there doesn't seem to be any misconfigurations.

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:45.770
Your knowledge and experience tells you that most encryption is transparent to

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.720
the user as long as they have appropriate login credentials and an authorized machine.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.805
Your intuition is telling you,

00:00:52.805 --> 00:00:54.800
this is an insider threat.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.920
You quickly get permission to deploy honey tokens in

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.995
the form of documents that are similar to the ones taken.

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:03.170
A honey token or canary token,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.900
is a file or record that is designed to be

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.175
abused and leave a trail leading back to the offender.

00:01:09.175 --> 00:01:12.300
Within 48 hours, you receive two alerts.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.440
One, new dark web alert and the other from the honey

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.805
token leading back to the employee leaking the data.

00:01:18.805 --> 00:01:21.590
The employee was leaving the company soon after being passed

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.590
over for promotion and wanted to cause damage on the way out.
