00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.605
Just a few moments ago,

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:03.300
we learned about the Caesar Cipher.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.550
Let's take a look at it in action.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.250
Here's a basic Python script that will perform

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.460
the rotation for us and give us our encrypted message.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.310
We can also use it to decrypt the message.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.870
To run the script, you type python and then the name of the script.

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:22.575
The message to encrypt, we'll type Brutus.

00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:24.990
The key will be how far we shift it.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.495
We're going to shift it over four letters.

00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:31.530
As you see, there's our output, f, v, y,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.430
x, y, w. Each letter shifted four spaces to the right.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.604
To decrypt, you type in the encrypted message,

00:00:40.604 --> 00:00:42.995
and then you go the opposite direction,

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:48.480
minus four, and there's the decrypted message.
