00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
In Lesson 1, we learned about valuable principles,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.975
processes, and procedures such as defense and depth,

00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:10.845
using the NIST 800 framework in developing your security program,

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:13.125
and finally, the principle of least privilege,

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.210
which popped up throughout the course.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.955
In Lesson 2, we learned about firewalls,

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:20.190
including learning our own basic rule.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:24.945
We learned terminology and best practices for securing our wireless infrastructure.

00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:29.550
We spent some time learning about intrusion detection and wrote a sample signature,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.130
and closing Lesson 2 out,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.180
we spent quite a bit of time securing Windows and Linux operating systems.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.645
In Lesson 3, we covered a bit logs,

00:00:38.645 --> 00:00:43.165
monitoring network traffic, and we closed it out with a look at SIEMs.

00:00:43.165 --> 00:00:44.585
In the final lesson,

00:00:44.585 --> 00:00:46.760
we had an introduction to encryption.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.040
We learned about encryption and transit,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.460
and we close that one out with file Hashes and Digital signatures.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.750
Now it's time for the project.
