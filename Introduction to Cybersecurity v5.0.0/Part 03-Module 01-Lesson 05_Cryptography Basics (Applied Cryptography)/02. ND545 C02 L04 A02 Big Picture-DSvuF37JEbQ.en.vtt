00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.645
We have spent the last three lessons learning about layered security.

00:00:03.645 --> 00:00:07.485
We have added layer upon layer to our security program.

00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:11.340
First, with security principles, policies, and procedures.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.305
Then we added host security,

00:00:13.305 --> 00:00:17.010
network security, and user management in the form of permissions.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.145
We learned about the importance of monitoring and alerting.

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:22.260
This is the final layer.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.820
In the end, the primary goal of cybersecurity for most organizations is to

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.290
protect the data of our customers and the intellectual property that earns us money.
