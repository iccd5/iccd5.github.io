00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
The first step of the hacking lifecycle is to understand the networks,

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.360
devices, systems, and applications you're revealing.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.760
This is known as reconnaissance.

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.830
Recall earlier lessons about

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.870
the NIST cybersecurity framework and the CIS critical security controls,

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.785
they both start the same way with an asset inventory.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:24.000
You have to know what you have in order to know how it's best secured.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.815
For this exercise, you need to take an inventory of your computers or devices,

00:00:28.815 --> 00:00:31.980
whatever you have around you in your home or apartment.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.245
You can use whatever device or computer you're using for this course for the exercise.

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:39.845
For example, if I was using my cell phone as an asset,

00:00:39.845 --> 00:00:44.580
it's an iPhone 8 with iOS 13.4.1.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.550
When you're completing the exercise,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.760
answer these questions about the device you're using for the course,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.555
such as, what's the hardware manufacturer, make and model?

00:00:53.555 --> 00:00:55.760
What operating system does it use?

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.455
Include the addition version and operating system build if available.

00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:04.535
Last, list two or three applications used on your device.

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:08.320
For each, include the version information if available.

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.520
You'll use all of this information in the next lesson on vulnerability management.
