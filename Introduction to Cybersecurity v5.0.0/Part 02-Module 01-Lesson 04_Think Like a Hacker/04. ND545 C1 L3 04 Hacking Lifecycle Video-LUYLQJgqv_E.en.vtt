00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.145
Real hackers, both good and bad,

00:00:02.145 --> 00:00:04.035
don't randomly attack things,

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:08.340
they use a specific life cycle or process to meet their goals.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.180
This is in order to categorize the assets, risks, threats,

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.575
vulnerabilities, and exploits affecting computer systems.

00:00:16.575 --> 00:00:19.035
It starts with a goal or target.

00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:23.640
In cybersecurity, this is the computer application or network you're assessing.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.505
Side note that you should never attack

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:30.960
a computer system you don't own or have explicit permission to attack.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.565
As you're setting your goal,

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:35.770
understand why you're assessing its security.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.170
Step 2 is to learn as much as you can about it.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.760
This means googling it.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.434
Hackers don't work from ignorance.

00:00:43.434 --> 00:00:47.525
Step 3 is to explore your goal from all perspectives.

00:00:47.525 --> 00:00:50.645
Understand how it works and what others know about it.

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:53.320
This is known as reconnaissance.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.160
In ethical hacking, you add Step 4;

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.835
break it if and only if you have permission.

00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:03.800
Here you understand the targets, weaknesses, or vulnerabilities.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:09.095
Hired security penetration testers may have an extra job of attacking the target,

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:14.180
which means exploiting those vulnerabilities to simulate how the bad guys may act.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.190
Those bad guys, by the way,

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.435
are known as threats.

00:01:18.435 --> 00:01:20.410
If you break something, well,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.065
you need to fix it. That's Step 5.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:25.735
In this step, you secure operating systems,

00:01:25.735 --> 00:01:29.180
applications, and networks to keep the bad guys out.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.185
Step 6, is part of the hacker ethos,

00:01:32.185 --> 00:01:35.275
where you always try to make the world a better place,

00:01:35.275 --> 00:01:38.435
figure out a better way to secure that asset.

00:01:38.435 --> 00:01:41.275
While evil hackers like to keep secrets,

00:01:41.275 --> 00:01:43.690
ethical hackers are the exact opposite.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.580
You tell others what you find.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.575
It's called ethical disclosure.

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:50.740
For example, if you notice a problem on a website,

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.910
you'll let the website owner know about it.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.310
It's really tied to making it better.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.750
You'll start with an exercise where you perform reconnaissance on your own computers.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.430
You will also perform reconnaissance on internet addresses to

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:09.390
understand what is publicly known about the internet assets.
