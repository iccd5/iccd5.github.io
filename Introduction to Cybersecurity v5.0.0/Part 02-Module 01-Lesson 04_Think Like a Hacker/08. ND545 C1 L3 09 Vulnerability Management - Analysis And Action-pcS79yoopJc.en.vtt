00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.195
The next step in the vulnerability management process is

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:06.675
analyzing the problems and deciding what to do about it.

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:10.240
For example, using our old car as the example.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.095
Let's just say there's a tire that's low on air,

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:14.985
what should you do about it?

00:00:14.985 --> 00:00:22.600
Well, you can put more air in it or you can replace the tire or do nothing.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.055
You need to analyze the situation and decide what's best for you and your pocketbook.

00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:31.410
While a new tire may be best,

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.425
it may be too expensive of an option.

00:00:34.425 --> 00:00:37.995
In IT, you need to make similar decisions.

00:00:37.995 --> 00:00:43.310
Software manufacturers may notify us that they have a patch to fix a bug.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.675
Do you install it right away or buy new and better software?

00:00:47.675 --> 00:00:50.635
Or you always have the option of doing nothing.

00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:55.055
The previously mentioned CVE and NVD websites

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.400
really help with this with their vulnerability ratings.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.505
You'll see this in the exercise.

00:01:00.505 --> 00:01:05.845
The software manufacturer may also tell you their idea of the risk.

00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:10.220
The last step in the vulnerability management process is taking action,

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.100
doing something about the vulnerability once you've analyzed

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.610
its risks and the benefits of applying effects.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.065
Let's say you decide to apply manufacturers update or patch within your business systems.

00:01:23.065 --> 00:01:26.195
Do you start applying it on everyone's computer?

00:01:26.195 --> 00:01:28.475
That could have some negative consequences,

00:01:28.475 --> 00:01:32.420
particularly if it affects some of the other software on that computer.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.850
It's best to test it first on

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.210
some expandable systems to make sure the update doesn't cause problems.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.030
Quick tangent on zero-day or O'day vulnerabilities.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.210
These are ones that haven't been made public.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.895
The software vendor may not even know there's a problem with their code.

00:01:51.895 --> 00:01:58.765
Black-Hat hackers may find them and use them to cause problems from the dark web.

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:02.645
These vulnerabilities can be actively exploited to cause harm.

00:02:02.645 --> 00:02:05.660
If you hear of a zero-day vulnerability and attack,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.800
you need to take action right away.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.840
The vulnerability management process can be long

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.860
and complex depending on your technologies.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.335
Consider how you will identify,

00:02:17.335 --> 00:02:23.190
analyze and take action next time you hear about a vulnerability.
