00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
In the Hacker Lexicon written in the 1990s by Eric Raymond,

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.170
"Hackers solve problems and build things,

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.995
and they believe in freedom and voluntary mutual help."

00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:12.645
Hacking is a mindset,

00:00:12.645 --> 00:00:16.365
a technique, a way of viewing our world.

00:00:16.365 --> 00:00:19.095
Hackers don't randomly try to break things,

00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:22.215
but follow a well-established process.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:27.840
I recommend you check out the Hacker Lexicon using the link available in the notes.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.820
The hacker process starts by determining their target,

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.100
learning all they can about it,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.325
exploring it from multiple perspectives,

00:00:38.325 --> 00:00:45.220
figuring out how it could break to better understand how it can and should be used.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.475
Throughout this lesson, you'll see the hacker life cycle in action,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:54.210
and you'll use it to build your cybersecurity intuition.
