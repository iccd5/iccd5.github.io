00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
In this lesson, you learned a little bit about how to think like a hacker.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.525
You covered the hacking lifecycle,

00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:11.865
vulnerability management process, and threats, attacks and exploits.

00:00:11.865 --> 00:00:16.020
By now, you should be able to categorize assets, risks, threats, vulnerabilities,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.290
and exploits using resources like the NVD,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.884
CVE, and Mitre Attack Framework,

00:00:21.884 --> 00:00:25.005
identify different types of vulnerabilities in the system,

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.740
identify the categories of a cyber threat,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.530
determine the phase of a cyber attack,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.175
and recognize common exploits.

00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:36.470
Use this information in your role as an IT or

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.745
cybersecurity professional to better secure your assets,

00:00:40.745 --> 00:00:44.520
information, data, and enterprise.
