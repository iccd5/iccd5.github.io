00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
Web browsing and e-mail are the top ways computers can get infected with malware,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.715
information is stolen, and data gets breached.

00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:11.235
Think about the number of e-mail you receive,

00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.500
and the number of websites you go to daily.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.150
If one one-hundredth of one percent is potentially malicious,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.730
there's a good chance your computer can be infected with malware.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:24.135
In this lesson, you'll understand

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:29.010
basic protection techniques for e-mail and other communication methods.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.625
I'll start by giving you ways to protect your e-mail.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:36.135
First, you want to have an inventory of e-mail accounts.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:38.970
Like we have an inventory of software and hardware,

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.995
we need one for the e-mail accounts too.

00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:44.780
For business, this means confirming all

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.465
of your employees e-mail accounts are still valid.

00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:51.620
I've known organizations that allow people to keep their e-mail even after they

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.795
terminate to help clean up accounts in case a client still contacts them.

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:58.370
The problem is that they'll forget they're

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.110
active and could be used to spoof malicious e-mail.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.110
Second, you should know if your e-mail information has been breached.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.400
The website haveibeenpwned.com provides this information.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.610
You'll get to test it as part of the exercise.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.470
Third, make sure you use a standard format for your e-mail addresses.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.120
For example, first initial,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.400
last name at company.com.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.435
Some use the full first name or have a period.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:30.590
So why is it important to have a standard format for e-mail?

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.540
Well, because if you have multiple formats,

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.160
it could be easier for a malicious hacker to spoof your email and someone not notice.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.215
You should also do this for your personal e-mail too.

00:01:41.215 --> 00:01:45.890
Another step that protects both your e-mail and your website domain is to

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.195
make sure your provider uses the e-mail authentication protocols,

00:01:50.195 --> 00:01:53.115
SPF, DKIM, and DMARC,

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:54.945
I'll explain these in a second.

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:57.940
These make it harder for scammers to impersonate

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.735
your domain and send phishing e-mails that look like they're from you.

00:02:02.735 --> 00:02:06.015
Sender Policy Framework, SPF,

00:02:06.015 --> 00:02:10.240
tells external receiving e-mail servers that your organizations

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.310
e-mail servers are proved to send e-mails from your business' domain name.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.920
Domain Keys Identified Mail or DKIM,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.050
adds a digital signature.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.535
It's like a stamp to your outgoing e-mail,

00:02:24.535 --> 00:02:30.750
so that external e-mail servers can confirm that your e-mail is from your domain.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.380
Domain-based Message Authentication Reporting and Conformance,

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:42.280
or DMARC, verifies the address the server uses matches the from address.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.680
It also tells external e-mail servers what to

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.780
do with potentially suspicious e-mail from your domain.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.725
When you send an e-mail from your organization using these security protocols,

00:02:54.725 --> 00:03:00.235
the receiving servers can confirm that you sent that email and it's not an impostor.

00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:02.555
If the e-mail is not validated,

00:03:02.555 --> 00:03:07.165
the receiving servers can send an alert or block the e-mail.

00:03:07.165 --> 00:03:09.470
We all love web browsing,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.935
but how do you know where you're going on the Internet is safe?

00:03:12.935 --> 00:03:17.345
How can you reduce the chance you'll get breached when your web browsing?

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:21.515
There are a few simple steps for web browser safety.

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:25.610
First, keep whatever browser you're using, whether it's Chrome,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:29.180
Firefox, Brave, Edge, whatever browser,

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.560
keep it up to date.

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.135
I'll explain how to do this in another session.

00:03:34.135 --> 00:03:40.160
Second, make sure that all the websites are using HTTPS,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.980
which is the secure version of HTTP,

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.230
that uses a protocol known as TLS, Transport Layer Security.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.715
This is the padlock you see on the browser URL address bar.

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:55.610
It does two things for a security.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.695
It encrypts the transmissions,

00:03:57.695 --> 00:04:00.410
meaning it scrambles what you send and receive,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.620
so no one in the middle can see it.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:05.865
Two, it provides a digital certificate,

00:04:05.865 --> 00:04:10.840
verifying the website you're on actually belongs to that organization.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.290
Third step is to use web browser security settings,

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.554
which includes pop-up blockers and managing your cookies.

00:04:20.554 --> 00:04:23.960
I'll demonstrate what this means next.

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.940
All of these are simple and low-cost steps to protect your e-mail,

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.730
web browsing, and other communications.
