00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.105
Defense in depth provides multiple layers on our computer networks, systems and data.

00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:10.440
It's like a castle that has multiple checkpoints to get to those crown jewels.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.000
Our modern computing system have multiple levels of security.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.905
By the end of this lesson,

00:00:16.905 --> 00:00:19.845
you'll be able to explain how security defenses

00:00:19.845 --> 00:00:23.235
are layered throughout the different system architectures.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.350
It starts with a network layer,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.910
usually a router that connects a network to other networks like the Internet,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.765
or a switch that connects computers to a network.

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:37.250
Today, mobile devices such as tablets and

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.765
smartphones are used in work environments and provide an additional layer.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:46.730
The operating system is the software that supports a computer's basic functions.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.225
This provides an additional layer of protection,

00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:53.500
for example, Windows and MacOS.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.440
Applications are on top of the operating system,

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.300
and in our example, it's databases.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.170
On top of that is the data that you access by the application,

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.390
this could be sensitive information like

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.589
tax data or your personally identifiable information.

00:01:12.589 --> 00:01:16.865
Surrounding all of these areas are humans,

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:19.485
which interact with each layer.

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:22.165
Now let's talk about layering protection.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:26.765
Each layer has some protection to keep the whole system safe.

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:32.035
For example, an employee that has access to a database of client information,

00:01:32.035 --> 00:01:37.660
they would first need to attach to the local network either directly at the worksite,

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.155
or remotely over the Internet through a VPN.

00:01:41.155 --> 00:01:43.840
The employee would then need to log into

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.660
the operating system using their valid credentials,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.910
a user ID and a password.

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:54.715
They would also need special permissions to access the database on the inner network.

00:01:54.715 --> 00:01:58.300
The server housing the database will also have layers of

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.030
defense with its own firewall and access control lists,

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.225
and should be hardened against attacks.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:11.920
The sensitive data should also be encrypted as an additional layer of protection,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.215
encryption is just the scrambling of the data.

00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:17.600
Whether they realize it or not,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.705
the employee touches each of these layers,

00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:24.875
although they may only think of the application and the data they may see.

00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:29.640
The more layers, the more secure the endpoints.
