00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
KeePass and other password managers reduce the need to

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.245
memorize multiple passwords for applications and websites.

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:13.335
A password generator application prevent users from creating easily guessable passwords.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:18.150
By using one, you can set much longer and complex passwords.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.585
Let me show you how KeePass works.

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:22.955
Just start by opening it.

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:25.694
In KeePass once it opens,

00:00:25.694 --> 00:00:28.275
click File, and then New.

00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:30.735
You'll need to create the new database,

00:00:30.735 --> 00:00:33.450
read the instructions when you do.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.900
Click Okay once you've read the instructions,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.330
and now you need to set the location for your master database.

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.300
I'm just going with the defaults.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.340
At this point, you need to create a master password.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.280
You want this something to be really long and really strong.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.710
I'm just setting a random password here.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.810
You can see the quality is not very good because I just used keyboard strokes.

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.600
If I begin to make it a lot longer and change some of the keyboard strokes,

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.895
it may change some of the quality.

00:01:10.895 --> 00:01:15.425
The three dots next to it lets you see what you're typing.

00:01:15.425 --> 00:01:22.545
Once you're ready, click Okay to set this password for your master database.

00:01:22.545 --> 00:01:25.730
You should then see the pop-up saying the password is week.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.385
I'm just going to go with this one.

00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:29.415
At this point I can name the database.

00:01:29.415 --> 00:01:32.295
I'm just going to call it TestDB.

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:34.380
Now, you see a pop-up for

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.355
the KeePass emergency sheet that contains important information.

00:01:39.355 --> 00:01:42.770
If you have a printer or you can just save this as a PDF,

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.380
consider printing this out because you may

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.665
need this if you ever lose or forget your master password.

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:51.400
So I'm just going to click Skip for now.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.310
As you can see within KeePass,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.900
we have some samples.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.675
In your database, you can then add items by clicking Add Entry,

00:01:59.675 --> 00:02:03.430
also found in the entry drop-down menu.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.340
So let's click on Add Entry.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.590
We can call this Website,

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.130
and this could be whatever website that I may be on.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.655
My username, there is a user name, of course.

00:02:13.655 --> 00:02:17.770
You can have it set or generate a password.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.810
The password generator is really a cool tool to enable unique passwords.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.430
You can set many of the different types of

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.825
special characters and the digits that you want.

00:02:28.825 --> 00:02:33.595
So I added that in there and I'm clicking generate a password.

00:02:33.595 --> 00:02:38.120
It automatically will generate a password for me that's long and strong.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.965
That I don't need to remember.

00:02:39.965 --> 00:02:42.925
When I'm ready with this entry, just click OK,

00:02:42.925 --> 00:02:46.854
and you can see it's automatically added into the database.

00:02:46.854 --> 00:02:49.550
KeePass has a number of other features.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.870
It's open source, meaning it's openly available and free.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.090
So I suggest you check it out to learn more about identity and access management.
