00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
Welcome to the fifth lesson of the course.

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.070
This lesson is about establishing security defenses on computer systems.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.450
By the end of the lesson,

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.430
you'll be able to explain ways to create and manage the security of a network,

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.490
computing environment, and applications.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.760
It's the protect function from the NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.280
What you need to do for: reducing cybersecurity risks

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.200
such as data breaches and disclosure by layering defenses.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.305
Preventing unauthorized access on your systems and networks.

00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:38.315
Minimizing vulnerabilities by keeping your devices and applications updated.

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:41.735
Using email and the web safely.

00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:44.720
The more you can automate these activities and establish

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.560
security procedures in these areas as a part of your normal routine,

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:54.900
the less chance you'll need to respond to or recover from a security incident.
