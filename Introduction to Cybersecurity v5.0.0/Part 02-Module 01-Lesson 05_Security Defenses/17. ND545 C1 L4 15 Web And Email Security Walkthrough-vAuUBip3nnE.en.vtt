00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.640
A simple way to protect ourselves on the Internet,

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.955
is to set up our browsers to be as secure as possible.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:08.865
This also protects our private information.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:13.575
Let me show you how to use Web browser security settings in Chrome.

00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.170
To access Chrome security settings,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:23.010
click on the three little dots at the top right corner, and highlight settings.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.310
This opens the Settings tab.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.740
In settings, you can then go to privacy and security,

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.710
and you can see all of the different security settings,

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.410
you have available within Chrome.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.000
You can clear your browsing history,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.220
and this basically removes your tracks on this local browser.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.920
This does not remove all of your tracks, by the way,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.230
this is just what you've been doing here within this browser.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.910
This will continue to show where

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.550
you've been on the Internet through your network routers,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.560
your Internet service provider.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.745
Just wanted to clarify,

00:00:58.745 --> 00:01:01.609
this just clears it for the local browser.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.240
You click the "Clear Data" button,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:08.560
and this will remove my history for the last hour.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.340
Now let me show you site settings within Google Chrome.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.930
These are all of the different security and privacy settings within Chrome.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.020
For example, what type of cookies may be collected?

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.530
Now, cookies are just little bits and trails that you leave on websites.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.515
I'll show this a little bit more in a future video.

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:31.385
The question here though is,

00:01:31.385 --> 00:01:34.880
are you going to allow sites to save and read your cookie data?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.290
It's recommended because really the Internet requires us to be fully functional.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.490
You can clear your cookies automatically when you leave Chrome,

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.490
and blocking third-party cookies will basically,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.155
if there's a site that has a third party website affiliated with it,

00:01:51.155 --> 00:01:54.820
you can say no, you can't leave cookies on my local machine.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.665
Other security settings within Chrome can be location, your camera.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:03.880
Can Chrome use your camera without asking you first?

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.794
Same thing with the microphone,

00:02:05.794 --> 00:02:09.470
as well as other types of notifications.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.240
There are many security and privacy settings available within Chrome and other browsers.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.165
Take some time to explore them on your own computer,

00:02:17.165 --> 00:02:21.180
to best protect yourself online.
