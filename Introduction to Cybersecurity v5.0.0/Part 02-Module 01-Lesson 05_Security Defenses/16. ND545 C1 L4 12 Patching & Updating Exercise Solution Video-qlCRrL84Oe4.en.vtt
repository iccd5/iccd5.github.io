00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.540
For this exercise, you want to make sure your software is up-to-date.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.795
You start with your software inventory to determine if there are

00:00:07.795 --> 00:00:11.625
any of your devices or applications need updates or patches.

00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:15.985
In previous lessons, we talked about having a hardware and software inventory.

00:00:15.985 --> 00:00:21.240
It's the first steps in security because it's needed in the patch management process.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.100
You're not going to fix something you don't own.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.520
For example, I use a Windows PC,

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.575
so I don't care about Mac patches.

00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:36.250
Next, compare your inventory with the patches available from the manufacturer.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.580
The intent, is for you to ensure all of the applications

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.035
you use are updated to the latest version.

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:46.520
So why aren't all of your applications up-to-date?

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.705
Well here are some reasons I came up with.

00:00:49.705 --> 00:00:53.420
Well first of all, it's an application you don't use very often,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.165
so you don't even think about keeping it up-to-date.

00:00:56.165 --> 00:00:59.210
How many apps do you have on your cell phone you

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.695
don't use and therefore you may not keep them up-to-date.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.650
Another idea is that maybe you don't realize it needs to be updated.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.560
For example, smartphone apps are updated

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.500
through a separate function and not as part of the app.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.045
So you need to be aware of when they need to be updated and often we just skip it.

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:22.130
You don't know or understand the impact of the update is another reason,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.740
you don't realize it could be really important.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.145
You weren't notified if it's important from the manufacturer.

00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:31.975
So we tend to forget about things we don't think about very often.

00:01:31.975 --> 00:01:34.460
You could also be fearful that, hey,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.915
if I apply this patch,

00:01:35.915 --> 00:01:39.485
it's going to stop me from being able to do what I need to do and work.

00:01:39.485 --> 00:01:42.155
So I'm going to wait to apply that patch.

00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:43.430
Then again when we wait,

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.980
we tend to forget.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.970
Last reason why we may not patch is,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.140
you want to make sure the application is fully tested

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.350
and vetted by others before you install it,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.890
following a standard patch management process to make sure

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.610
there are no surprises when you're installing these updates.
