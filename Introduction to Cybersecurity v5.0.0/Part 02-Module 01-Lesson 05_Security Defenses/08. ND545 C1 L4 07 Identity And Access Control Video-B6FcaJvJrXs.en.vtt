00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
This section is about controlling access to computer systems applications and data.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.560
By the end of this section,

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.490
you'll be able to explain parts of identity and access control and

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.720
identify common identity and access control protection techniques.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.755
Think about when you log into a computer or application.

00:00:19.755 --> 00:00:23.370
It starts with your user ID which is also known

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.240
as an identifier which lets the computer know who you are.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.120
This is usually an e-mail address or

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.565
some form of your name like first initial, last name.

00:00:33.565 --> 00:00:36.800
But how do you prove it's really you?

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.535
I mean, figuring out someone's login ID is pretty easy.

00:00:40.535 --> 00:00:43.145
That's why we need a second part.

00:00:43.145 --> 00:00:48.305
Something that proves it's really you also known as authentication.

00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:51.190
This is often a password, or a pin,

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.110
or on some devices like your smartphone,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.490
it can be your fingerprint or face for biometrics.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.250
Third way is that device itself that can also be used to prove it's you.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.350
All of this is to confirm to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.955
a remote computer that it's really you and not some imposter.

00:01:10.955 --> 00:01:15.455
In a nutshell, this is what identity and access control is all about.

00:01:15.455 --> 00:01:17.410
Proving who you are.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.140
For stronger security and to ensure it's really you we use

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.400
something known as multi-factor authentication or MFA.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.765
This is something you know like your password,

00:01:29.765 --> 00:01:33.350
something you are like your fingerprint, or voice,

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.760
or even facial recognition or something you have like a smart card or smartphone.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:45.350
Many websites like my bank now use multi-factor authentication.

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.310
I'll sign in with my user ID and then password and

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.320
then get a code sent to my phone that I then need to enter.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.130
So it's something I know and something I have.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.570
There is another part of access control, authorization.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.220
This answers the questions of,

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:10.130
what should you be allowed to access once you login with your user ID and password?

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.100
Can you see everything on a network or just certain computers or applications?

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.635
What should you be allowed to do?

00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:22.609
Managers in the organization should answer these questions.

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:27.260
Authorization can also be based on what you need to do with the object,

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.780
which is your access rights.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.335
Do you need to only see or read the file,

00:02:33.335 --> 00:02:35.705
or do you need to make changes to it,

00:02:35.705 --> 00:02:38.915
or delete or execute it if it's a program?

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:41.465
All of these permissions can be set for

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:46.115
individual items and for individual users within an operating system.

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:51.470
Authorization limits access based on the principle of least privilege.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.620
Only have access to the stuff you need to do your job.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.435
Let me give you quick examples.

00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:04.595
First, if you're flying and you need to go through TSA security,

00:03:04.595 --> 00:03:06.185
you provide your ticket,

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:07.865
which is your identifier.

00:03:07.865 --> 00:03:12.040
It shows you have a need to be in the secure area of the airport.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.865
You also need to provide something to authenticate it's really you.

00:03:16.865 --> 00:03:20.765
An official document like your passport or driver's license.

00:03:20.765 --> 00:03:23.660
Then you need to be authorized to

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.995
a specific area of the airport and then a specific plane.

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:32.270
You're only allowed to ride on the plane not fly it.

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.615
That's also a type of authorization.

00:03:34.615 --> 00:03:38.855
The equivalent in computers is your user ID

00:03:38.855 --> 00:03:42.950
which is your identifier tied to your password or pin,

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.860
or maybe even your fingerprint.

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.680
Then you're allowed to access specific data or

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.465
files or applications within that particular computer system.

00:03:53.465 --> 00:04:00.210
You'll now practice setting identity and access control configuration in the exercise.
