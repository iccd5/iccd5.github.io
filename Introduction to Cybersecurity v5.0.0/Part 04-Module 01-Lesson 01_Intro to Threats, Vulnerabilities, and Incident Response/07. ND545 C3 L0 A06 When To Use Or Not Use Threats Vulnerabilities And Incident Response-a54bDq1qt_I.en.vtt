00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.535
Being able to identify threats,

00:00:02.535 --> 00:00:04.020
find and fix issues,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.610
and respond when warranted is a critical process for businesses.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.380
They should be used in every organization's cybersecurity program.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.335
There aren't many cases I can think of where this would not apply.

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:20.655
However, there's one thing to note in terms of things not to do.

00:00:20.655 --> 00:00:22.680
As a professional in this space,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.310
you'll learn how to do some things that malicious hackers usually do.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.520
However, they should always be used ethically.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.510
These should not be used without authorization or beyond ethical guidelines.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.365
For example, hacking into a database to view employee salaries or

00:00:39.365 --> 00:00:41.930
using what you've learned to try and crack

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.820
your significant other's password without consent.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.480
Those are not acceptable ways to use the skills that you

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.680
learn as you advance through your cybersecurity development journey,

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.420
so it's important to maintain

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.950
the highest ethical and moral standard as a cybersecurity professional.
