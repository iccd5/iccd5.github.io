Hi and welcome to this exciting course on threats,

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:05.985
vulnerabilities and incident response.

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:09.630
I'm Dr. Christine Izuakor your instructor and I'm thrilled to walk you

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.470
through such a critical part of the cybersecurity domain.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.030
A little bit more about me.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.285
I've been in the cybersecurity industry for over a decade,

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:23.055
leading numerous cybersecurity functions within Fortune 100 companies.

00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:27.005
I spent a good portion of that time monitoring systems,

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:32.075
finding vulnerabilities, working around the clock with various teams to fix them,

00:00:32.075 --> 00:00:34.160
and also responding to incidents.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.785
So I've seen first-hand just how critical

00:00:36.785 --> 00:00:40.445
these functions are in securing companies of all sizes.

00:00:40.445 --> 00:00:44.630
I also completed a PhD in security engineering and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.250
went on to teach graduate level cybersecurity classes as well.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.930
All in all, I'm very passionate about developing the next generation of

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.240
cybersecurity professionals who come from so many different backgrounds around the world,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.175
and that includes you.

00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:05.220
I couldn't be happier to be exploring this topic with you.
