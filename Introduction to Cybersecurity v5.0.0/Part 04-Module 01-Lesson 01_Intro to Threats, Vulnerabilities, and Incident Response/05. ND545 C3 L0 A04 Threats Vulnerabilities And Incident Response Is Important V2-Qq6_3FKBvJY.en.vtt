00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.320
It's no secret that cyber attacks and threats are on the rise.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.170
However, here are some interesting stats that highlight

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.905
the importance of topics you'll learn during this course.

00:00:10.905 --> 00:00:13.500
First, threats are on the rise.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.830
According to The University of Maryland's research,

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:24.675
hackers execute an attack every 39 seconds or 2,244 times daily.

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:29.265
So basically, there are plenty of threats to go around and it never ends.

00:00:29.265 --> 00:00:33.330
Even more concerning, is that you'll learn throughout the course that

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.370
hackers are not the only threat relevant to the cybersecurity industry.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.780
Vulnerabilities also continue to grow and failing

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.185
to address them can lead to severe consequences.

00:00:45.185 --> 00:00:50.190
In one case, 134 million credit cards were exposed.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.060
That cost Heartland payment systems over

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.900
$145 million in compensation for fraud payments alone.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.879
That doesn't include response costs,

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.255
operational costs, and other expenses.

00:01:05.255 --> 00:01:07.445
The attackers in this case exploited

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:10.370
a known common vulnerability that analysts

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.535
have been talking about for years to carry out this attack.

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:20.155
Lastly, being able to detect and address issues through incident response is critical.

00:01:20.155 --> 00:01:25.310
According to IBM, it takes an average of 206 days to

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.935
identify a breach and it takes about 314 days to contain a breach.

00:01:30.935 --> 00:01:37.085
That means it takes almost a year to get a good handle on a security breach.

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:40.250
Also know that most attackers create a

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.075
backdoor so that they can keep coming back when they want,

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:45.980
as long as they are not detected.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.415
So can you imagine an intruder hiding in your home undetected for 206 days?

00:01:52.415 --> 00:01:54.425
That's essentially what this is like.

00:01:54.425 --> 00:01:58.615
A real example of this can be seen in the major Marriot breach.

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:02.630
So in that case, 500 million customers dating back

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.505
to 2014 had their information compromised,

00:02:07.505 --> 00:02:14.070
but it wasn't made public and addressed until about four years later in 2018.
