00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.835
Managing threats, vulnerabilities, and incident response requires a collective effort.

00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:11.100
Security professionals do a lot of the hands-on work to understand,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.740
find, and analyze threats.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.970
Management also provides oversight and support for this entire process,

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.025
including the security program.

00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:23.040
IT support groups may work hand-in-hand with

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.205
security professionals to fix security gaps and

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:32.715
also respond to incidents by making configuration changes and more to contain damage.

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:36.989
HR can be involved for a variety of reasons as well, for example,

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.985
if the cyber threat actor who carried out the attack is an employee of the company.

00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:47.405
Legal teams may play a role every step of the way to ensure compliance with mandates,

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:49.735
especially during incident response.

00:00:49.735 --> 00:00:53.300
Sometimes, response and the aftermath of a breach

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.260
may involve a lawsuit or formal prosecution,

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.170
which would then need legal support.

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.595
External groups can also be considered stakeholders from the victim's impacted by

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:07.760
incidence to law enforcement agencies or

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.420
business partners depending on the magnitude of the impact.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.460
This is not a definitive list.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.700
Cyber security is full of curve balls that may

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.630
warrant additional support or involvement from other groups,

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.630
but this is a good starting point to become familiar with.
