00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.690
Threats have been around well before civilization.

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.350
Meteors were clearly a threat to dinosaurs,

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.100
Saber-toothed tigers were a threat to cave people.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.130
As the world evolved, so did threats.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.124
In the modern world for example,

00:00:16.124 --> 00:00:21.630
bank robbers became threats to banks and the institutions had to find ways to understand,

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.170
identify, mitigate, and respond to these threats.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.190
Today, as the world relies more heavily on digital assets,

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:34.320
the threat evolution has only been amplified and the same process applies.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.230
Companies have to understand the digital threats and how to manage them.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.180
Now a key differentiator in this evolution and present day threats and issues

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.595
is that threats no longer have to be physically present to inflict damage.

00:00:49.595 --> 00:00:52.250
Cyber threats can be activated and

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.200
vulnerabilities exploited from almost anywhere in the world.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.535
Virtual bank heist for example,

00:00:58.535 --> 00:01:01.730
costs the financial industry billions of dollars and you

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.450
no longer have to walk into a bank with a mask on to rob it.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.040
That's where we are today.
