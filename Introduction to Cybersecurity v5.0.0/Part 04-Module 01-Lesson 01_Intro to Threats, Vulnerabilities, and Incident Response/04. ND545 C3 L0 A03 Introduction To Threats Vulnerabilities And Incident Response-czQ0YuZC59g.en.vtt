00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.325
This course is all about threats,

00:00:02.325 --> 00:00:04.650
vulnerabilities, and incident response.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.260
So you'll learn how to answer questions like,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.650
"What's the greatest cyber threat I should be concerned about?"

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.035
Or "How can I find and fix

00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:17.190
security issues that threat actors may try to take advantage of?"

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.140
Another common one is "If I'm faced with a security incident or a potential breach,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.639
how can I respond?"

00:00:23.639 --> 00:00:27.315
These are all very important questions that almost every

00:00:27.315 --> 00:00:33.220
cybersecurity professional will be tasked with answering at some point in their careers.
