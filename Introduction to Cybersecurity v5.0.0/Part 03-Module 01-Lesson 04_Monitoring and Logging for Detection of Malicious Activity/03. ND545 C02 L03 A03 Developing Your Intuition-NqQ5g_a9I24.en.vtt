00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.235
We learned in a previous lesson

00:00:02.235 --> 00:00:05.955
that intuition lies at the crossroads of knowledge and experience.

00:00:05.955 --> 00:00:09.495
There's no better example of this than when monitoring your environment.

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:14.835
For instance, party or monitoring includes alerts for logins in foreign countries.

00:00:14.835 --> 00:00:19.595
Your knowledge tells you it isn't uncommon for members of your organization to travel.

00:00:19.595 --> 00:00:23.850
So the alerts are reviewed on a schedule as opposed to real time.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.090
Your experience tells you that Stephanie in sales,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.500
often travels to Europe.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.570
So the alert from a login in the Netherlands isn't necessarily actionable just yet.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.420
However, the intuition you've developed by

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.000
reviewing these logs everyday tells you that when reviewing,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.975
you search all of the logins from the affected team members around the time of the alert,

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:46.795
not just when the alert fired.

00:00:46.795 --> 00:00:50.000
In doing so, you see that the alert fired for

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.795
a login from the Netherlands at 11:00 pm and one hour later,

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.135
Stephanie logged in from Austin, Texas.

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:59.435
In cyber security, this is called the Superman theory.

00:00:59.435 --> 00:01:02.660
Only Superman could go from the Netherlands to Austin,

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.295
Texas in one hour.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:07.880
It is likely that Stephanie's credentials have been compromised.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.365
By using the data your systems provide you and your own intuition,

00:01:12.365 --> 00:01:15.095
you have mitigated a threat to your organization

00:01:15.095 --> 00:01:19.050
much more quickly and proactively to many of your peers.
