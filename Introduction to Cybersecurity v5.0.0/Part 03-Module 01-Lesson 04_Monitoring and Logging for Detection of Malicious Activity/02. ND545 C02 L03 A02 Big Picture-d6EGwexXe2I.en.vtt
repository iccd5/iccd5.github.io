00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
There's a saying that what gets measured gets control.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.030
This applies to system health statistics in

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.190
your computing environment that let you spot

00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:11.145
problems and opportunities before they become an issue.

00:00:11.145 --> 00:00:17.370
For example, say a celebrity posts a photo of your product on their social media page,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.910
there would be a rapid increase in visits to your website.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.490
By monitoring performance statistics,

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.155
you could be ahead of that wave.

00:00:25.155 --> 00:00:28.230
A sudden spike in failed login attempts is

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.245
a possible indication of an attack in progress.

00:00:31.245 --> 00:00:34.175
If an IP address is attempting connections to

00:00:34.175 --> 00:00:37.100
hundreds of ports on your public facing IPs,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.790
you are likely being scanned for vulnerabilities.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.175
By establishing baselines and understanding your environment,

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.115
eventually, it all comes together almost as a story.

00:00:46.115 --> 00:00:50.160
You can tell when something is wrong based on alerts long before the systems crash,

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.765
or an adversary compromises the system.

00:00:52.765 --> 00:00:57.065
By collecting and processing events and system logs correctly,

00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:58.910
you can adequately monitor

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.240
your environment to successfully mitigate these issues and more.
