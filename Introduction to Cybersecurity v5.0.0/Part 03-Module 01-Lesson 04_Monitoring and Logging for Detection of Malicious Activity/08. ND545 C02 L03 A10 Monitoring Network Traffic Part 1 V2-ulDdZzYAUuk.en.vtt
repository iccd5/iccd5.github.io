00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.385
Now that we've learned about event logs,

00:00:02.385 --> 00:00:05.595
let's turn our attention to monitoring network traffic.

00:00:05.595 --> 00:00:07.665
By the end of this section,

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.680
you will understand why you should monitor traffic,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.640
choose the types of traffic to monitor in your organization,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.295
what methods are available to collect data,

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:20.840
view active connections in Windows and Linux.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.044
Finally, interpret reports from network devices.

00:00:24.044 --> 00:00:28.570
Where does monitoring network traffic fit in our three component model of security?

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.335
Somewhat in prevention, but primarily in detection and response.

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:34.730
Why should we monitor traffic at all?

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.140
At a bare minimum,

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.960
every organization should monitor firewall logs for

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.515
failed attacks as well as suspicious successful connections.

00:00:42.515 --> 00:00:45.370
These are generally the first sign of an attack.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.395
As we learned earlier, by monitoring traffic,

00:00:48.395 --> 00:00:52.565
you can intercept some performance problems before they become big problems.

00:00:52.565 --> 00:00:54.530
You can use network traffic and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.840
other performance statistics to know when to scale your operations.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.710
Finally, many compliance regulations require monitoring of specific devices.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.140
The types of traffic you'll want to monitor

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.055
vary greatly from organization to organization.

00:01:09.055 --> 00:01:12.050
However, there are some fundamentals worth covering.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.175
As previously stated, you'll want to monitor your firewall closely.

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:20.480
Think of your firewall as the first alarm to sound in a potential attack.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.705
If your organization has a public facing presence,

00:01:23.705 --> 00:01:26.720
you'll want to monitor all traffic to and from it.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.480
It's possible your public facing servers will run as normal while being compromised.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.645
It is a good idea to monitor the logs on your wireless network,

00:01:35.645 --> 00:01:39.095
particularly if your organization has nearby neighbors.

00:01:39.095 --> 00:01:42.845
Anywhere you have sensitive data or intellectual property,

00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:45.830
you will want to know what traffic is coming and going.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.320
The last thing your organization wants is to

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.410
notify customers and partners of a data breach.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.455
There will no doubt be traffic specific to your organization that you'll want to monitor.

00:01:56.455 --> 00:01:59.645
With so many different types of devices communicating,

00:01:59.645 --> 00:02:02.405
there are likely hundreds of collection methods.

00:02:02.405 --> 00:02:06.085
We're going to take a high-level look at several of the most common.

00:02:06.085 --> 00:02:09.575
NetFlow is a Cisco proprietary technology

00:02:09.575 --> 00:02:12.350
that allows the collection of data on network traffic.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.200
It collects information on source IP,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.945
destination IP, source port,

00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:20.400
destination port, and protocol.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.405
SFlow is an open standards version that can be used on other products.

00:02:25.405 --> 00:02:30.760
These are excellent for collecting statistics on items such as switches and routers.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.485
SNMP, Simple Network Management Protocol,

00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:36.505
performs similarly to NetFlow.

00:02:36.505 --> 00:02:40.190
There are security risks to consider before implementing SNMP,

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.825
such as traffic sniffing,

00:02:41.825 --> 00:02:44.240
man in the middle, and brute force attacks.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.960
Wireshark is a free and open source packet analyzer.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.730
It is used for network troubleshooting,

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.285
analysis software, and communications.

00:02:52.285 --> 00:02:55.760
Netstat stands for network statistics and as

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.620
a command line utility to show active connections and routing information on hosts.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.235
We'll be taking a closer look at this in a moment.

00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:06.560
Perfmon is a Windows performance monitor

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.565
that provides tools for analyzing system performance.

00:03:09.565 --> 00:03:12.790
It is likely your organization will run several of these and

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.585
potentially more to collect the data desired for your monitoring solution.

00:03:16.585 --> 00:03:19.135
Whether trouble-shooting an application issue

00:03:19.135 --> 00:03:22.120
or investigating if a machine is compromised,

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.490
viewing active connections can yield valuable information.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:30.255
We'll use Netstat and Perfmon to see what's connecting to your machine.

00:03:30.255 --> 00:03:33.995
You can use your own windows machine or connect to the server provided.

00:03:33.995 --> 00:03:37.540
Hit the "Windows" key and type PowerShell and hit "Enter".

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:39.400
Then type Netstat.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.760
The local address is the address of the machine we're on,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.200
the multiple listings are representing different connections.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.810
The foreign connections are all the IP addresses our machine is connected to.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.715
As you can see, this could be very valuable in researching an issue.

00:03:54.715 --> 00:03:56.730
Now let's try Perfmon.

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.410
Hit the Windows key and R to pull up a run dialog,

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.565
type Perfmon /res and hit "Enter".

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:06.895
You should see something similar to this.

00:04:06.895 --> 00:04:10.309
While it does not include as much information as Netstat,

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:13.115
it does include the PID by default.

00:04:13.115 --> 00:04:16.610
The PID is the process ID that could help you

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.150
track down an application if you noticed something suspicious.
