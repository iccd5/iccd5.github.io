00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.695
Log on to the provided Windows 2016 server and open Internet Explorer.

00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:08.770
Open microsoft.com, add a new tab,

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.840
and go to google.com and one more of your choice.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.615
Click the "Windows Start" button and type "PowerShell" and hit "Enter".

00:00:15.615 --> 00:00:18.825
Type netstat. What entries do you see?

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:22.640
You can see all the IPs that are currently connected to this machine.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.220
Your output will vary,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.170
but should look something similar to this.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.585
Notice all of the different IP addresses.

00:00:28.585 --> 00:00:33.310
This is from the machine being hosted at Azure connecting to various Microsoft servers,

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.880
as well as the connections established by your Internet Explorer traffic.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.605
Try it on your home machine and see what you find.

00:00:39.605 --> 00:00:42.750
This is exercise 2 in monitoring network traffic.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.320
You were tasked with providing mitigation steps

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.765
to the events in this screen capture of a threat report.

00:00:47.765 --> 00:00:52.195
Let's see how you did. Here are several considerations for mitigating the threat.

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:56.885
Contact the system owner in your organization to see if the traffic is expected.

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:00.335
Occasionally, a configuration problem can generate this traffic.

00:01:00.335 --> 00:01:05.710
If it's unexpected, contact the abuse contact of the registrar of the offending IP.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.175
Look up the IP on abuse IPDB or VirusTotal to see if it's deemed malicious.

00:01:11.175 --> 00:01:13.515
If yes, consider blocking.

00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:18.814
You can go one step further and recommend that SSH is blocked at the border firewall.

00:01:18.814 --> 00:01:20.285
If SSH is needed,

00:01:20.285 --> 00:01:23.340
use a VPN for additional security.
