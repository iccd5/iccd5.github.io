00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
Here we are in our Windows lab environment.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.960
If we wanted to check for failed login attempts to save time,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.835
we could open up PowerShell.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:12.430
Be sure to right-click and run as administrator,

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.285
and then run the following command.

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.665
Git event log.

00:00:19.665 --> 00:00:21.524
The log name is security,

00:00:21.524 --> 00:00:24.150
the instance ID is 4625,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.179
which you will recall are failed logins,

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:29.490
then we're going to look at the newest 25.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.370
In this case, we spotted something interesting.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.595
We also want to do a deeper dive in Event Viewer.

00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:38.085
To get there, hit your Windows key,

00:00:38.085 --> 00:00:41.770
type Event Viewer, hit enter,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.495
navigate to Windows logs, security,

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:50.700
sort by audit failure,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.340
and there we can view the event 4625s that have happened on this machine.
