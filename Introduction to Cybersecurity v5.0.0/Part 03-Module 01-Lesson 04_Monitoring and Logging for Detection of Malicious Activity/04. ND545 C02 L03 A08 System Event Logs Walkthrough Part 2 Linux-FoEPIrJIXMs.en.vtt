00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.135
If you recall from just a few moments ago,

00:00:03.135 --> 00:00:06.225
we viewed failed login attempts on our CentOS machine.

00:00:06.225 --> 00:00:08.925
Let's do that in real time and see what we find.

00:00:08.925 --> 00:00:13.245
Remember, we're using the audit app to make the logs more readable.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:21.420
Type the command sudo and aureport space minus AU space minus I,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.860
space dash, dash failed, and hit Enter.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.740
Because of sudo, it's elevated privileges,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.810
we have to enter our password again.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.220
As you can see, there are a lot of failed login attempts.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.140
That is why good security and good monitoring are a must.
