00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Computers are all around us.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.580
There are the obvious ones like our phones,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.565
tablets, laptops, desktop computers.

00:00:08.565 --> 00:00:11.940
But there are also the computers we don't see in our cars,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.310
TVs, speakers, and watches.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.175
These are known as the Internet of Things,

00:00:17.175 --> 00:00:19.365
which is anything connected to a network.

00:00:19.365 --> 00:00:23.220
We also have the cloud that enables systems, applications,

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.185
and data to be reached from anywhere using almost any type of device.

00:00:28.185 --> 00:00:29.725
On top of that,

00:00:29.725 --> 00:00:34.400
we see a wide variety of apps and websites containing our sensitive data.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.680
What happens if that data is leaked?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.870
Can it be used to steal our identity or cause a bigger attack like ransomware?

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.190
Malicious hackers are stealing billions of dollars annually.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.230
All of these devices, apps,

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.740
and tech require multiple levels of security to ensure they

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.945
are only being used for the purposes in which they are intended.

00:00:55.945 --> 00:00:59.570
To protect all of these devices and applications takes

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.325
large workforce and multiple types of security products.

00:01:03.325 --> 00:01:11.510
By 2024, the security industry is expected to grow to over $300 billion.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.760
That includes all of the types of

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.440
security services such as hardware devices like our network, firewalls,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.910
software like antivirus or endpoint protection programs,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.310
and having someone watch over

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.675
an organization's infrastructure like a security operation center.

00:01:29.675 --> 00:01:30.950
To fill this need,

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.179
businesses today are looking for qualified cybersecurity professionals.

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.390
That's where you come in.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.700
Throughout this lesson, you'll understand why

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.690
security is so important and how you can play a part.
