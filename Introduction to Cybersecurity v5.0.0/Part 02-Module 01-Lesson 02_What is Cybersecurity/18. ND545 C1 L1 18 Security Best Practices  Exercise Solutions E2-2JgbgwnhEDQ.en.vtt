00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.730
You've now completed Exercise 2,

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.925
as a part of the security best practices session.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:10.725
The intent of this exercise was for you to explore virustotal.com,

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:16.395
and see how we can supplement a device's antivirus and endpoint protection program.

00:00:16.395 --> 00:00:18.300
Let me show you how it works.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.425
As you can see, I typed in Udacity's website in the search bar.

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:24.540
If I click "Search",

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:29.000
you will see the results where the website was compared

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.735
against 70 plus different antivirus programs.

00:00:33.735 --> 00:00:36.770
Keep in mind, an anti-virus program by itself

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.070
is only about maybe 50-60 percent effective.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.040
Wouldn't it be nice to check against many different types

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.270
of antivirus programs like the ones you see here.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:52.845
You can also use VirusTotal to detect potential malware as a part of a file.

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:57.690
Hopefully, the file you uploaded on the site had no viruses detected.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.980
Please share this site with your friends and family as

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.920
an extra layer of defense against malware.
