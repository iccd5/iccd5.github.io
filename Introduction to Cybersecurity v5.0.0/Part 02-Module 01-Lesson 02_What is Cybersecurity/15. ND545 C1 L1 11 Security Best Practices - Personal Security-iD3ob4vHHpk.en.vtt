00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
It's important for you and really all consumers to know

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.300
some basic cybersecurity best practices for

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.165
protecting your information devices and network.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:11.880
We call this cybersecurity hygiene.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.455
Like hand washing, these small and simple steps make large differences.

00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:19.530
In this video, I'll provide you with tips for keeping yourself,

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:21.405
your family, your community,

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.940
and your businesses safe online.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.275
The tips are separated into three areas: personal security,

00:00:28.275 --> 00:00:31.580
device security, and network security,

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.244
and will help you apply the security fundamentals,

00:00:34.244 --> 00:00:36.260
including core security principles,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.705
and critical security controls in your world.

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:42.590
It's important to understand how to protect yourself

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.745
online from the scams through social engineering.

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:49.730
You should recall that social engineering is an attempt to trick someone into

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.215
revealing information like a password or credit card information,

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:59.980
and this can then be used to attack other systems or networks or people's bank accounts.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.380
How do you defeat social engineering?

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.380
Well, first of all, think before you click.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.060
What this means is before you click on that link,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.600
give a quick look to see whether it's valid or not.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.850
Tip 2, trust your gut,

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.920
which just means, be a little skeptical.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.735
If something doesn't feel right,

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:23.240
very well may not be right.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.630
Third, when in doubt, ask somebody.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.370
It's the easiest way to defeat social engineering.

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:33.010
When you log in, you enter a User Id.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.720
You also need to prove that user Id belongs to you and you're the one using it.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.320
That is often done with a password.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.820
The problem is that passwords are a weak form of security.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.370
We often use things we can easily remember,

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.470
like names of family members, pets,

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.145
sports schemes, or even cars.

00:01:51.145 --> 00:01:54.560
Anyone who knows us can potentially guess our passwords.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.845
Passwords can be cracked using special programs,

00:01:57.845 --> 00:01:59.860
especially if they're short.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.285
For extra security on our accounts,

00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:04.250
we need to use long passwords of

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.930
at least wealth characters that contain numbers and special symbols,

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.135
and whenever possible, I recommend a passphrase instead of a password.

00:02:14.135 --> 00:02:16.685
For example, I love ice cream,

00:02:16.685 --> 00:02:19.180
but where you substitute some of the letters.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.220
If you use something about you as your password,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.895
then there's a much greater chance that someone could guess it.

00:02:25.895 --> 00:02:28.270
So don't use anything about you,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.100
like a child's name or a pet.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.675
It's also not a good idea to reuse passwords because if someone knows your old password,

00:02:35.675 --> 00:02:38.045
they can figure out your current password.

00:02:38.045 --> 00:02:42.565
The problem with long and complex passwords is that they are hard to remember,

00:02:42.565 --> 00:02:45.060
plus there are so many.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.120
An option is to use a password manager program that remembers your passwords for you.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.415
You store your password for websites and applications in your password vault.

00:02:54.415 --> 00:02:57.050
You then use the vault whenever you need a password.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.635
You'll experiment with password managers as part of the exercises throughout this course.

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:06.080
Passwords are known as single-factor authentication,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.099
which means it only uses one form to prove our identity.

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.750
It's better to use multi-factor authentication or MFA,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.945
which may also be known as two-factor authentication.

00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:21.635
The different factors are something you know,

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:24.275
such as a password, something you are,

00:03:24.275 --> 00:03:26.570
like your fingerprint, face,

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:27.935
or even your voice,

00:03:27.935 --> 00:03:29.960
or something you have or possess,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.485
like a smartphone or a car.

00:03:32.485 --> 00:03:36.500
For example, many banks today require that you get a PIN sent to

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.660
your smartphone along with using

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.950
your personal password to access their application or website.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:47.420
This uses something you know your password and something you have your device.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.135
If you use your fingerprint on your phone,

00:03:50.135 --> 00:03:53.155
it's something you are and something you have.

00:03:53.155 --> 00:04:00.060
This reduces the possibility that someone may access your devices or account as you.
