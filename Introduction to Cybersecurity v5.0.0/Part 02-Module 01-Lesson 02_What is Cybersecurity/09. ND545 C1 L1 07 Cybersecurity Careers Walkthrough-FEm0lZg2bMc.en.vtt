00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.795
There are many opportunities in the world of cybersecurity.

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.360
It's not about the sheer number of jobs,

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.095
but also the types and breadth of work available.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.500
In this session, we'll talk about the opportunities

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.860
available and the jobs you can get in cybersecurity.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.345
I'll share a national resource where you can learn more about them.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:26.605
Currently, we're experiencing a phenomenon known as the cybersecurity skills gap.

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.510
This is the number of job openings compared to

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.755
the number of cybersecurity people available to fill them.

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:37.745
ISACA, an international professional organization focused on IT, audit,

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:43.280
governance, risk and security conducts an annual survey on the state of cybersecurity.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.150
Their 2020 report demonstrates the challenges of hiring cybersecurity position.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.330
Two-thirds of hiring managers in security say it's hard

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.575
to both find and retain cybersecurity talent.

00:00:57.575 --> 00:01:01.040
What does a cybersecurity professional look like?

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.660
For this answer, we'll check with ISC-squared,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.255
a well-known worldwide cybersecurity certification organization.

00:01:09.255 --> 00:01:14.630
They also conduct annual surveys of their members regarding the cybersecurity workforce.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.930
From their 2019 study,

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.780
you can see the amount and type of education and

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.605
the typical ages for cybersecurity professionals.

00:01:23.605 --> 00:01:26.785
For example, you see that you need some level of

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:31.285
education in order to land that cybersecurity job.

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:34.555
Also from the ISC-squared 2019 study,

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:36.820
you can see the top areas hindering

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.985
cybersecurity professionals from progressing in their careers,

00:01:39.985 --> 00:01:43.015
including costs, career path opportunities,

00:01:43.015 --> 00:01:44.905
and lack of knowledge.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:48.450
To build a career in cybersecurity or technology takes

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.210
three things: experience, education, and certifications.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.650
Experience means you need

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:59.600
that hands-on opportunity to learn with the different types of technology.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.760
This can either be on the job through

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.225
a classroom or even through cybersecurity competitions.

00:02:05.225 --> 00:02:10.190
Education is that formal classroom opportunity where you're

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.595
learning from a professor or some type of an instructor to receive a degree.

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:18.650
The third part are certifications like

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.550
the Certified Information Systems Security Professional from ISC-squared,

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.120
or Certified Information Security Manager from ISACA,

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.850
or security plus from CompTIA.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.620
These are all well-known security certifications that can help you land a job.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.160
Also needed to fill a cybersecurity role are

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.485
technical skills and get hands on ability on different types of operating systems,

00:02:42.485 --> 00:02:46.105
network technologies, or security devices.

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:49.684
Functional knowledge is usually within a particular category,

00:02:49.684 --> 00:02:53.585
like healthcare, utilities, or finance.

00:02:53.585 --> 00:02:57.800
Then last and probably most important are personal abilities.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.915
The ability to communicate.

00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:02.060
You can be the best hacker in the world,

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.170
but if you can't explain to people what you've found and how it can be fixed,

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.410
you've lost half the battle.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.890
The US National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST,

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.395
has a National Initiative for Cyber Education called NICE.

00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:20.990
Their mission is to energize and promote a robust network,

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:23.510
an ecosystem of cybersecurity education,

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.805
training, and workforce development.

00:03:25.805 --> 00:03:28.730
The NICE cybersecurity workforce framework is

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:34.385
a nationally focused resource that categorizes and describe cybersecurity work.

00:03:34.385 --> 00:03:36.740
On their one pagers website,

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:41.345
they have numerous tip sheets showing the demand for cybersecurity workers,

00:03:41.345 --> 00:03:44.030
the value of security certification,

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:50.060
and additional resources as a way of building your cybersecurity career.

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.135
A few you can see on their website include cybersecurity competitions,

00:03:56.135 --> 00:03:59.959
workforce demand, and cyber ranges.

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:05.825
Use this as another resource as you are building your cybersecurity career.

00:04:05.825 --> 00:04:08.450
Use these resources as you're building

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.350
your cyber career to develop your path and reach your goals.

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.950
Take a few minutes to visit the websites and reflect on

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.600
the information that can help you establish or broaden your cyber career.
