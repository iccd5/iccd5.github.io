00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
There's another security concept that I'd be

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.890
remiss not to mention in an introductory class on

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.125
cybersecurity: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:12.720
It's around everything we do.

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.155
Confidentiality is keeping our secret secret.

00:00:16.155 --> 00:00:21.870
It means limiting who can see or read sensitive information.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:28.260
Integrity is limiting who can change or modify that information.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.705
Availability is ensuring our information or devices is there when we need it.

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:40.310
Let's use a public website like Udacity as an example.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.425
The confidentiality is low since it's there for anyone to read,

00:00:45.425 --> 00:00:49.825
except for that proprietary content like this lesson.

00:00:49.825 --> 00:00:53.975
The integrity should be high because we want to make sure

00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:58.135
only those people who should change it can make changes.

00:00:58.135 --> 00:01:00.995
Availability, well, we'll just call that medium,

00:01:00.995 --> 00:01:04.205
since the amount of harm may or may not be that great.

00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:07.900
Of course, this depends on the website.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.030
Look around you and all the places you use

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.365
these security principles often without thinking.

00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:18.319
As you work through this course and work as a security professional,

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:21.409
consider all the ways we use economy of mechanism,

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.510
least privilege, failing safe,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.435
choke points, and defense in depth.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:30.590
Also consider how you use CIA: confidentiality, integrity,

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.550
availability, and how it fits in your world of security.
