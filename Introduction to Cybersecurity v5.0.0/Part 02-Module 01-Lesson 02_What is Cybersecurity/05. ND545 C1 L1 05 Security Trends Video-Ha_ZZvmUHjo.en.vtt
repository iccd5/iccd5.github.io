00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Cybersecurity incidents and data breaches are now a part of our lives,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.325
and security is integrated in what we do,

00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:10.620
how we act, and even where we go,

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.335
both online and in real life.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:15.060
In the first part of the lesson,

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.480
we'll identify current trends in malicious activity,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.735
technologies, and protection techniques.

00:00:21.735 --> 00:00:24.120
The exercises will have you review

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.460
current cybersecurity events and ways organizations are responding to data breaches.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.210
In May of 2020,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.385
the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center celebrated its 20th year.

00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:41.180
This graphic demonstrates how cybercrime continues to build,

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.700
plaguing consumers and businesses alike,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.570
with the number of complaints growing to over five million as of March 2020.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:56.945
In 2019, victims reported more than $3.5 billion in losses,

00:00:56.945 --> 00:01:06.740
an average of $7,500 for each of the 467,361 complaints recorded that year.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.525
The continually growing number of cybercrime complaints is one trend.

00:01:11.525 --> 00:01:15.560
Others include how cybercrime is done using phishing,

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.340
ransomware, and business e-mail compromise.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.620
Social engineering is still the number one way

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.040
people and businesses are scammed out of their money.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.545
Smart devices, the Internet of Things,

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.604
and Cloud services all make our lives easier,

00:01:30.604 --> 00:01:35.060
they also are new ways for malicious hackers to attack.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.880
This all means more opportunities for cybersecurity professionals.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.160
Phishing has been plaguing everyone online for many years.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.190
Today, there are many variations such as spear phishing,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.775
which is an attack against a specific individual.

00:01:52.775 --> 00:01:57.895
Whaling is phishing, but going after executives in a company.

00:01:57.895 --> 00:02:01.290
Smshing is using text messages.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.070
So you get a text with a weird link in it,

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.760
which is a type of spam and phishing.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.090
We're even seeing it with voicemail or vishing,

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.590
where you get a voicemail saying,

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.140
please contact us at a specific number,

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.150
often trying to get a user ID and password,

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.575
or your money like a credit card.

00:02:20.575 --> 00:02:24.620
Last, we're seeing phishing through instant messages,

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.675
like in a chat where they're using Google Meet or Zoom or any of the others.

00:02:29.675 --> 00:02:31.730
Be aware of what people are sending you,

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.705
and report anything that appears weird.

00:02:34.705 --> 00:02:38.925
All of these are ways to use ransomware.

00:02:38.925 --> 00:02:42.590
Ransomware is a type of malicious software designed to

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.325
block access to a computer system until a sum of money is paid.

00:02:46.325 --> 00:02:49.715
Often, the perpetrator wants bitcoin

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:53.435
in exchange for cryptographic keys to unlock your files.

00:02:53.435 --> 00:02:56.390
Basically, your computer is locked with bad guys

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.930
holding the key until you pay that ransom.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.000
This has caused multiple millions of dollars in damages.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.450
Business E-mail Compromise, or BEC,

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.105
is an exploit in which an attacker obtains access to a businesses e-mail account,

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:18.079
and imitates the owners identity in order to defraud

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.565
the company and its employees, customers, or partners.

00:03:22.565 --> 00:03:28.280
The FBI has a comprehensive explanation of BEC on their website,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.340
and the link is available in the notes.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.935
Social engineering is another trend,

00:03:33.935 --> 00:03:38.585
generally involves hacking humans and is an attempt to trick someone

00:03:38.585 --> 00:03:43.220
into revealing information like their user ID and password or credit card.

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.880
It can be used to attack systems or networks as well.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.415
It's the old con job where someone tries to pretend to be someone they're not,

00:03:52.415 --> 00:03:55.385
whether it's online or in real life.

00:03:55.385 --> 00:04:01.310
A cybersecurity trend that is beneficial is the use of smart devices such as phones,

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.175
watches, thermostats, lightings, cameras,

00:04:04.175 --> 00:04:05.675
and even our cars.

00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:08.480
These send and receive data via the Internet

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.965
and is known as the Internet of Things or IoT.

00:04:11.965 --> 00:04:17.180
Tied to much of this is the use of Cloud services that allow access

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.010
to applications and data from a variety of devices and from almost anywhere.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.745
With the benefit of these devices, come a downside,

00:04:25.745 --> 00:04:28.309
making sure they are secure,

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:31.670
and that only authorized people and systems can access them.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.850
Also, they need to be hardened to

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:38.765
ensure they cannot be used in ways they're not intended.

00:04:38.765 --> 00:04:42.590
The last item on our list of security trends is that all of

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.550
this means more opportunities for cybersecurity professionals.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.850
Soon we'll talk about cybersecurity careers.
