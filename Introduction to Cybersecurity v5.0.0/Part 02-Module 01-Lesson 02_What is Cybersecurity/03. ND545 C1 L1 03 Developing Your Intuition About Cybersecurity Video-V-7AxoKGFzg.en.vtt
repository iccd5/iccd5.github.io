00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Well, many things, cybersecurity is just about technology.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.160
It's really a lot more than that.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.965
It's an art as well as a science.

00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:12.210
Developing a security mindset means having the ability to understand

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.634
the past and current trends to better understand the future.

00:00:16.634 --> 00:00:18.269
It's about being curious,

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:21.075
tenacious, and always learning.

00:00:21.075 --> 00:00:24.565
It takes a certain mindset to understand security.

00:00:24.565 --> 00:00:28.850
In March 2008, security guru Bruce Schneier

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.260
spoke about the security mindset in his blog, Schneier on security.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.900
In the article, he explained his methods for

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.435
developing your intuition about cybersecurity.

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:41.440
You really need to câ˜‘heck it out using the link.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.480
Security professionals look at the world differently.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.550
We try to figure out how things work to better understand how others may break it,

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.100
and what we need to do to protect it.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.970
For example, we walk into a store or airport or museum.

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.120
We naturally look for security guards and cameras.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.600
It's the same on computers where we look for vulnerabilities and

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.925
error messages to better understand how the technology works.

00:01:06.925 --> 00:01:09.290
We try to figure out how security can be

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.595
bypassed to better understand how it can be strengthened.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:16.535
In developing your intuition about cybersecurity,

00:01:16.535 --> 00:01:19.275
consider three mantras or ideas.

00:01:19.275 --> 00:01:22.620
First is trust but verify.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.060
This means to double-check everything we do because

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.770
one thing missed can mean millions of dollars lost.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.485
Stop, think, connect means to take a timeout when something doesn't feel or seem right,

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:40.205
take a few seconds to think about it before you click or connect.

00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:43.190
It comes from the US Department of Homeland Security as

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.900
their way to help everyone be Cyber Safe.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.905
If you see something, say something.

00:01:49.905 --> 00:01:52.145
This means to report what you find.

00:01:52.145 --> 00:01:55.865
For example, if I'm surfing the web and I get an error on a website,

00:01:55.865 --> 00:01:57.980
I'll report it to the website owner.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.380
Throughout this course and your life,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.570
continually be building your security mindset and developing your security intuition.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.480
You'll quickly learn that it will serve you well.
