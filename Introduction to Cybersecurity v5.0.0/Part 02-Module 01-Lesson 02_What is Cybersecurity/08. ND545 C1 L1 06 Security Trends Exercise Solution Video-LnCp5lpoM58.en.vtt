00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.175
A resource for recent data breach information that is used by cybersecurity professionals

00:00:05.175 --> 00:00:10.920
worldwide is the Verizon Data Breach Investigations Report, or DBIR.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.915
For over a dozen years,

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:18.990
the report provided an analysis of data breach trends affecting a variety of sectors,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.545
including public administration, health care, and education.

00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:26.970
In this exercise, you explore the current DBIR that it contains

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.665
analysis from over 32,000 security incidents worldwide,

00:00:31.665 --> 00:00:36.930
of which 3,950 were confirmed data breaches.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.660
Let's look at some of the report findings.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.285
In the 2020 DBIR,

00:00:42.285 --> 00:00:46.490
we see that 72 percent of victims were

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:51.010
large businesses and 28 percent were small businesses.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.480
Seventy percent of the attacks and

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.245
breaches happen because of someone outside of the company.

00:00:57.245 --> 00:01:00.140
But what's interesting is that 30 percent with

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.280
someone on the inside or those internal actors.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.110
The different tactics that are used include hacking at 45 percent.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.585
If you're wondering how much social engineering plays,

00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:15.605
that's 22 percent and then 17 percent for malware.

00:01:15.605 --> 00:01:20.765
We use the Verizon Data Breach Report to better understand where attacks are happening,

00:01:20.765 --> 00:01:24.830
how they happen, and then how to put our protection in place.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.770
Even though these values change over time,

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.350
the general concepts have remained steady.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.630
Take time to understand this report as it's used throughout the cybersecurity industry.
