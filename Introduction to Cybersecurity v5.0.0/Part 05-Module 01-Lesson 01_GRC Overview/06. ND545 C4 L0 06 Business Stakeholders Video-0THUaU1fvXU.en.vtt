00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.805
I mentioned earlier this idea of harmonizing

00:00:02.805 --> 00:00:05.865
external forces with the practice of Cybersecurity.

00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:09.705
I think this is still one of the most interesting parts of GRC today.

00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:14.730
GRC professionals must be able to bridge a gap between the organization,

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.690
its needs, and security.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.380
But it's often difficult for

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.520
pure Cybersecurity professionals or business stakeholders to articulate the role of GRC.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.260
Now, in my mind,

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.765
the roles aren't always clear either.

00:00:29.765 --> 00:00:33.275
As much as GRC is intended to support security,

00:00:33.275 --> 00:00:38.440
it's imperative that the job is accomplished with the context of the business's needs.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.980
In order to do that,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.490
GRC professionals must be prepared to work alongside

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.735
business stakeholders to understand how they intend to sell more product,

00:00:47.735 --> 00:00:51.555
improved payroll, or expand into new markets.

00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:55.235
Whatever the day-to-day activities of the business happen to be.

00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:58.490
In that way, GRC must be

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.080
well-rounded business functions with insight into all parts of the business.
